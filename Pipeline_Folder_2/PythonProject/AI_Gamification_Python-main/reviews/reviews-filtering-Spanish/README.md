## Filtering

The reviews are in spanish, so the reviews are filtered with two different dict. One has just the spanish translation of the gamification features and their synonyms and stems, the other has both the spanish translations as well the original english words used in filtering the english reviews.The two dictionaries are in the **feature-list_Spanish.csv** and **feature-list_Spanish_English.csv** files.

The same filtering for the english reviews are then done on the spanish reviews, performed twice according to the two different criteria. The files corresponding to the reviews filtered with spanish words end in **_Spanish** and the files corresponding to the reviews filtered with both the spanish and english words end in **_Spanish_English**.
