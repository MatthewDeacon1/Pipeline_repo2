0,2017-09-29 04:15:45,"I wanted to learn coding during my commute. But so many free to start apps require a constant Internet connection, and my train is often stuck underground without service. I greatly appreciate that you can use Encode even offline. (It being offline also means that it can't load the ads, if you find that annoying.)

The lessons included are indeed simple, and I absolutely think if you're an intermediate study in JavaScript or HTML/CSS you won't get much out of this. But as a beginner cramming these lessons in to/from work, who was only ever able to make good old 90's GeoCities webpages at best, the bite-sized chunks it's broken down into makes computing language much easier for to process.

The extra challenges as reinforcement and the compound lessons putting everything together is worth the $4.99 unlock, but even if you're looking to just start learning for free you could do much worse than Encode.",5,False,jellocube,Perfect for beginners!,,NEGATIVE,wanted learn coding commute many free start apps require constant internet connection train often stuck underground without service greatly appreciate use encode even offline offline also means cant load ads find annoying lessons included indeed simple absolutely think youre intermediate study javascript htmlcss wont get much beginner cramming lessons tofrom work ever able make good old 90s geocities webpages best bitesized chunks broken makes computing language much easier process extra challenges reinforcement compound lessons putting everything together worth 499 unlock even youre looking start learning free could much worse encode,challenges,challeng
2,2019-09-05 02:30:21,"So I learned all my basics for HTML and CSS through Encode (the previous name before Knowin) and I have to say I loved the interactive, hands-on, you-type-it mode that It had. But don‚Äôt get me wrong, this app is still very good at teaching the basics for coding in any of its available subjects. But just as someone who still remembers the very interactive mode of Encode, I do miss it. Personally it was better for me to type it out than to press buttons to questions. So if its possible to bring this back into Knowin, that would be awesome. Like I said awesome app that can teach you so much, I would just like to see that type-it-yourself mode back. But overall, it is a very solid app, good job developers!",4,False,JrD1az,"Good for learning, but wished that the Hands-On was there again",,POSITIVE,learned basics html css encode previous name knowin say loved interactive handson youtypeit mode dont get wrong app still good teaching basics coding available subjects someone still remembers interactive mode encode miss personally better type press buttons questions possible bring back knowin would awesome like said awesome app teach much would like see typeityourself mode back overall solid app good job developers,status quo sloth,person
4,2019-07-18 08:52:58,"After this app made the switch from Encode to Knowin, I had my doubts, but the interface itself is beautiful and intuitive, plus the themes (plum, sea, and night) are gorgeous. The ghost of Encode still haunts the app when it opens, and sometimes the swipes lag a little, but that‚Äôs to be expected with such a massive overhaul & turnaround for an education app. Not nearly enough to warrant taking off a star, especially when the app itself is supplementing my coding journey so well.

148,2022-05-30 14:38:05,"I am a total beginner at coding and downloaded this app, as well as a few others. I want to say before giving my complaints/suggestions that this IS a decent way to memorize how to code. It doesn‚Äôt feel so much like learning through practice so much as learning through reading. It‚Äôs still informative and teaches you to code and what everything (well, most things) is for and how/why/when/where to use it. 

First off, just a minor suggestion for the devs: this app doesn‚Äôt keep score or reward  your progress really, other than ticking off the lessons you‚Äôve completed, which is fine honestly, it‚Äôs certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think it does make learning apps like this more enjoyable and fun to use. 

Second, the lessons feel a bit condescending sometimes. The way the answers to the questions are usually just the value of one of the blank spaces of the code and you just tap it and it appears in the space, and a lot of times it‚Äôs just one space that needs to be filled in so it just feels like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in me tapping the ONLY answer there is, and having it just appear in the blank space?‚Äù Feels a little kindergarten to me. And again, it DOES educate you on coding, it‚Äôs just more of a READING way of learning, like reading a slightly interactive book basically, where sometimes you need to fill in one of the sentences with the word(s) that belong there‚Ä¶literally. 

Third, and this is again just another personal opinion/suggestion based on preference, but the app just feels very plain and basic I guess is the best way to describe it. There‚Äôs just really no ‚Äúpop!‚Äù or personality to it. And I understand it‚Äôs an app about learning how to code, and code is often very plain and boring and concise looking, so I understand it not being anything crazy, I just wish there was a little more personality to the app and that it was a bit more interactive than it currently is. As mentioned above, there‚Äôs no reward or incentive for doing anything on there, which is fine, the learning of new things about coding is absolutely a reward in itself. However, it would be nice to have a little more feeling of connection and interaction with the app and a little more incentive and personality. 

I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a complainer just being captious about the app and picking it apart. I do appreciate the dev(s) taking the time to create this app to help people learn to code, because it is a nice little interactive textbook of coding information at this point, and it is appreciated being provided with that information. I just wish it didn‚Äôt feel so condescending and plain. With a few little tweaks I really think this app could be amazing because it does explain things very simply and easy to understand and learn. 

Thank you! If you made it this far and read the whole review, you‚Äôre beautiful and I wish you all the best in life and in coding!!! <3‚Ç¨><>

159,2020-08-31 22:17:41,"So.... learning any coding language is super hard, especially when you‚Äôre using an app. (I‚Äôm too young for Mimo, my Swift Playgrounds photo work course feels more like a dragging lesson than a coding lesson, and Code playground is just a book (coding is learned best hands on).)
It‚Äôs very hard to remember what you learned.

So.... Knowin comes along!
An awesome app for learning coding languages and actually remembering them.
I recommend this app for people that are having a hard time learning coding (that aren‚Äôt that serious about learning to code).

The number I chose was 10^100(10**100 in Python), equivalent to one googol. After I tried to print the three letter word ""Yes""('Yes' in Python) the app crashed.
