The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a “lives system” like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don’t go premium. Once you run out it’s roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning. This has been the best experience I have ever had in my journey to learn how to program. Between the textbooks and other online courses, this is hands down my favorite experience.",5,False,BreadOne2Three,… And it’s all free,POSITIVE,app absolutely amazing language basic grasp going python started taking webdevelopment coursescurrently 20 certification able fly pace mimo encourages learning healthy sense challengecompetition keeps becoming demanding challenges enough keep interested best part app free enacting lives system like typical phone game would lives5 exact pretty much enough get one day assuming dont go premium run roughly three hours one heart essentially encouraging coming back daily learn also simple daily streak mechanic encourages daily involvement previously mentioned competition leaderboard slightly encourages trying harder learning best experience ever journey learn program textbooks online courses hands favorite experience,"daily streaks, challenges, leaderboard/competition, torture breaks, status quo sloth","daily streak, challeng, leaderboard, live, leaderboard"

Even then, I learn best after making mistakes, and losing all the hearts fast means my inability to keep learning which discourages me from opening the app at all.

If I were one of the developers of the app, I’d know the hearts is a good tactic for users to buy Mimi pro. On the other hand, I’d know that if I stretched that tactic too far, there would be less traffic on the app, which means less ad revenue in the first place. This is especially true considering the majority of users don’t have a pro subscription.

11,2021-11-14 06:18:14,,"Very odd navigation required of app. I’m constantly finding myself thinking I need to hit the “next” but twice because two subsequent buttons live in the exact same spot for each action to continue a lesson (a UX no-no for mobile devices). 

Also, questions are way too easy, or too hard because of wording. Getting a question wrong usually attributed to poor grammar in the question (it’s incredibly important to hire a native English speaker to review all material before publishing it), then action required to submit the correct answer requires back tracking, dispute the visibility of the existing multiple choice widgets appearing to still be tappable. 

It’s ok learning web dev from this app but I don’t think the Duolingo approach necessarily works well.

First of all, the heart system. Seriously, whenever you make a mistake you have to wait 4 hours to keep coding? It seems kind of unfair.

Second of all, the leaderboard has been glitching the past few days. Another reason I use Mimo is because I want to stay first on the leaderboard, but for some reason, it wasn’t updating.

878,2022-04-28 00:14:47,,"This app is very helpful for grasping and visualizing the basics of programming. I love the mini apps it walks you through along the way because most of my discouragement while learning programming has been “okay… I know what this does… but what do I use it for?” Lol. The leader boards add a nice competitive touch that keep me engaged as well. The only negative thing I would say is that there can be an awful lot of hand-holding, even when you’re further into a topic. For example I was just going through comparisons in JavaScript and it spent several pages telling me how a greater-than (>) operator checks to see if one value is greater than another. But on the final page the instructions were “check if this number is greater than another *by typing >*”. Personally I feel like it’s harder to lock those ideas in because you don’t really have to. The instructions tell you exactly what you need to pass, and if you get an answer wrong it immediately corrects you by telling you the right thing to type. In one sense I understand you don’t want to make it too hard for beginners. But in another it almost feels like it removes the necessity for me to access my own memory and solve the problem myself. Like if I was learning math and something said, “Solve 5+5 by typing 10.” It feels disappointing at times because I’m thinking, “We’ll shoot. I would have liked to initiate my own brain resources to figure that out, but I’ve accidentally glanced at the answer by reading the question.” Lol. However, it should be noted that at later modules it does pull back and let you work things out by yourself a little more. So it’s not a COMPLETELY overbearing teacher. 

BESIDES that possibly minor nit-pick though, I really love this app. I’ve tried a few others and they don’t feel nearly as engaging. They tend to fall on the other side of the spectrum where they either just leave you hanging without much clue what to do. Or there’s no interactivity and it’s just strictly multiple choice questions. This app actually has you type things out (or select from predefined options, which is easier to handle on mobile).

1093,2020-08-16 08:04:11,,"(Be ready for a long review :)) 
 I have used this app for a while now and although I really love this app, the biggest problem is the hearts/lives. I wish that there would be either more lives, or lives that come back quicker. The lives take too long to return (4 hours/heart) and it discourages me a little. Sometimes I would accidentally pick the wrong choice or have a typo (as there is no autocorrect in coding) and poof, a heart is gone. 
The hearts are the biggest flaw but here are some of the minor flaws...the instructions and friend invites. I don’t know if it’s just me, but sometimes a question is unclear and I have to really think about what the right answer is. And because the hearts take a long time to return, when I only have one heart left, I just end up quitting the lesson and choosing a different one. Second is the friend invites. Recently, I found out that you can invite friends to earn a free week of pro so I sent out a couple of invites. I had one friend sign up for Mimo and it shows up that I have seven days of Mimo pro but my account is still in the free version. Additionally, I’ve had some people tell me that they signed up for mimo using my invitation link, but it only shows up as seven days. 
Overall, this is a really great app and I really enjoy it. The interface is nice and fun, and it definitely keeps you hooked to do more lessons.

I do mind that I set aside time to seriously do this and then get ‘punished’ and given a 3 hour time out by answering tricky worded quiz questions incorrectly. I understand the nature of the questions and how they are doing double work sometimes in the way they instruct towards an intuitive sense of the programming language. That’s all great and very appreciated but punishment and a time out to encourage people to cough up the $80 when we’re already watching ads? If you have a tiered payment system like that that allows for access to those who can’t afford the $80 then go about punishing them it seems very disingenuous. Time is valuable. If I schedule and set aside valuable time to do this and want to focus for a few hours and then get timed out it’s really infuriating. Get rid of the hearts and quiz punishments.

They currently have SQL and Python languages. There is also a section for web development using HTML that integrates the process of building websites, however I have not looked into this to date. 

They have introductory lessons of learning, but I will provide an update in my response. I am really loving this app due to the fact that I personally practiced Python in the past, but seemed to have issues remembering some aspects to properly complete a working program that functions without syntax errors. As I have been doing the lessons, it is all coming back.

I am VERY curious of whether they intend on adding more languages into this application, as it is very resourceful. I’m excited to see the development of this app!

The only complaint I have is that they offered a 50% discount for the pro version due to the current hardships of some people face during current events. I wanted to see if it was worth it before making the purchase, however it took a few days to get past a few lessons and realize that this application is an asset. Now the offer previously offered is no longer available… I wish I could have taken advantage of this opportunity, however it has expired before I realized the potential.

1298,2020-06-17 09:07:17,,"I’ll preface this review with a fact about me; I rarely write reviews. It takes a lot for something to either wow me enough or disappoint me enough to leave a review. In the case of Mimo, it frankly has knocked my socks off! 

I’m using Mimo alongside precourse material for my upcoming bootcamp and honestly, it’s providing more information in a more accessible format. Everything is explained very well and delivered in a way that just clicks with how I learn. 

You’re also given the opportunity to really drill the information into your head by maxing out the stars. It can be a bit repetitive to do this but I actually think that’s a good thing; once I get annoyed with covering the same thing over and over I know I’ve got the knowledge. 

I’m always a bit hesitant with app based learning programs because I always feel like I’m going to get to the point where I want to learn more and then they’ll tell me that I need to upgrade. That’s not the case with Mimo! The free version is very robust and has all of the information on HTML, CSS, and JS that you need to get started. The only thing I can see that would require a membership is the projects which, while great, aren’t necessary to learn the information; mainly just practice. 

Unfortunately, I was planning on learning the material first and then tackling the projects but my discounted pro price expired. It’s all good though, as I said, the free version is great! There’s a small ad at the end of each lesson but they’re very easy to click out of and only last a couple of seconds. 

The only thing I’d like to see from Mimo is an option to access the lessons from a computer. Obviously, I’m not going to be doing web dev on my phone so it would be nice to get the practice in on desktop. Projects are available on desktop though so if I decide to spring for a pro subscription I will be taking advantage of that. 

I’ll end this with a thank you to Mimo for providing this amazing service! If you’re thinking about trying this app, absolutely go for it!

1331,2021-06-10 23:11:28,,"If you’re looking for a free learning app, I can’t suggest this one unless the heart system gets reworked. Basically you have 5 hearts and lose 1 every time you get an answer wrong. You can get your hearts back but it takes 4 hours each. 1 at a time.

Aside from this, it would be a 5 star app. I love everything else about it.

Basically there comes a time where you might need to wait at least 4 hours to continue learning. That’s right, you’re not allowed to learn when you want to unless you pay or just go start over on another free app that doesn’t do this. Oh and I say at least 4 hours because if you lose all of your hearts, you might want to wait until you have 2 hearts for padding before you try again. Falling to 0 hearts means you may have to start your lesson over. The lessons are short, but it’s frustrating.

So how easy is it to lose hearts?

Okay so I accidentally wrote “poo()” instead of “pop().” A funny mistake, but I lost a heart. Next I was following instructions on something and it didn’t tell me if I should add the curly brackets yet or not. Well apparently not, and I lost a heart even though the curly brackets were supposed to go there. Mimo just didn’t want me to add them yet. Another time I actually wrote the correct answer and it failed me and told me to write the same thing.

1375,2020-05-21 22:12:53,,"I came to Mimo as an absolute novice when it comes to coding. I had minimal experience with HTML and no experience whatsoever with any other coding languages. At first, I found the lessons fun and engaging, and within a couple of weeks I felt like I had a decent understanding of the basic mechanics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These principals are taught in bite-sized lessons, similar in structure to Duolingo. Two things the program does really well is providing side projects that allow you to apply your knowledge and skill challenges that allow you to test your understanding of the material. This is what drew me in initially.  

However, when I tried to dive deeper into some of the other lessons Mimo has to offer, I was incredibly disappointed by how shallow the material was. Their Python course, for example, is only spread out over 11 lessons, and there are none of the aforementioned skill challenges or side projects that allow you to solidify your knowledge. I had the same experience when trying to learn C#. It seems that they’ve put quite a bit of work into HTML, CSS, and JS, but not nearly enough into their other offerings. 

They have a system in place where you can repeat a lesson three times (which I only learned by contacting tech support - nowhere in the app does it tell you this), with each level supposedly being more difficult than the last. Except they’re not more difficult - it’s mostly just the same info, over and over again. Half of the questions tell you exactly what to do, so it feels more like rote repetition than actual learning. Overall, I get the sense that Mimo’s marketing strategy is to make it seem as though they offer more material than they actually do, and to stretch that information over as many units as they possibly can. 

I paid for a month of Pro, which I don’t regret. I got a lot out of this month of learning. But I feel like I’ve already hit a wall with what this app can offer me, and I don’t think I’ll be renewing.

Honestly I bet that may be a flaw and a cause for people to leave the app as soon as they get it. 
A suggestion for this would be maybe look at letting users do higher levels, but without a subscription put the it on a time limit. If funding is that big of an issue, I don’t really know how well newer users will do. For example:

Letting users unlock all the levels, however. For every activity (getting started, etc.) have an extended wait until they could do the next level (30 mins, 3 hrs, 1 day, etc.). This way users would still be pushed to get a subscription, but can still access and enjoy the app. Also, maybe insert adds in-between lessons for non-subscriptions, or you could even put the option of using adds to shorten the wait time by a bit. 

That being said, the app in itself looks really great! Which is why I give it four stars, it’s just the fact that you need at LEAST a $10 subscription to go past the first level of any course that I wouldn’t really recommend it yet.

I love the concept of this app and a lot of things are made quite clear and concise through the lessons. I found the introduction to hacking very straightforward. However, I see a _lot_ of mistakes in the lessons, especially typos or missing words in the exercises, which sometimes makes it unclear what the exercise is actually even about. I’ve been trying to report these kinds of things but have so far received no indication that my reports have even been received. I was also a bit disappointed by the need to pay $50/year in order to do just about anything in the app. You really should give a more in-depth preview before you force people to pay. Also, if you already have programming experience, it’s unclear if you can skip ahead to more advanced topics. Maybe the target audience is only complete beginners, but if that’s the case then the $50/year is _definitely_ not worth it. Also, as sort of a side note, the update notes here on the App Store are bugged out. How can you not have noticed that???

Please extend your preview, fix your errors, lower the cost, and add content for more advanced users. I don’t think you want people to feel like they’re being scammed.
