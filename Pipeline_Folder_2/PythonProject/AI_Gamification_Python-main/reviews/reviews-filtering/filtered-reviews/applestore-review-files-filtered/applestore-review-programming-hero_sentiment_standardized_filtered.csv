I recently had a hard time getting into my degree thanks to the change of pace COVID brought, and I was looking for a tutor originally but instead found this app. I am so glad I found it, this has saved me from paying for an expensive tutor and has improved my understanding of programming. 

There are minor bugs I have found, such as: when you get to certain points in the building of ‚Äòyour game‚Äô sometimes you won‚Äôt be able to take an action (e.g. shoot a missile at the planet); also when you do the challenges, sometimes even if you click the correct answer it will say you clicked the wrong one and you‚Äôll get it wrong either way. 

Overall amazing app and I would recommend this to any student or person who is trying to get into coding. I‚Äôve spent thousands on professors that couldn‚Äôt teach what this app can.",5,False,ls_royalty,"Amazing way to teach, but some minor bugs",POSITIVE,im currently student going university computer science degree ive fair share different ways programming taught recently hard time getting degree thanks change pace covid brought looking tutor originally instead found app glad found saved paying expensive tutor improved understanding programming minor bugs found get certain points building game sometimes wont able take action eg shoot missile planet also challenges sometimes even click correct answer say clicked wrong one youll get wrong either way overall amazing app would recommend student person trying get coding ive spent thousands professors couldnt teach app,"challenges, status quo sloth","challeng, person"

Emailed support multiple times to provide feedback on issues and the common response has been ‚Äúwe will fix it soon‚Äù.

 It has been over 3 months and the delay has prevented progress which has also resulted in forgetting previous concepts learned.
