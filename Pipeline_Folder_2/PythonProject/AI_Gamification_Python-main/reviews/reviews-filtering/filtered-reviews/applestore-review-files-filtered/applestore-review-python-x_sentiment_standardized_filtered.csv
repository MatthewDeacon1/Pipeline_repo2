17,2021-09-22 20:03:24,"‚Ä¶.I must say that I am genuinely enjoying the course and the direction with which PythonX so expertly guides me to learn while also at times allowing me the luxury of forgetting that. It‚Äôs fun! It‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs educational! Not always such an easy task to achieve.
    
    Hands down, my favorite aspect of PyX is that periodically you are given attention grabbing projects that one can without doubt appreciate. From the level of engagement that enthralled, to the head scratching challenge provided by each progressively perplexing problem PyX captured my interest. The developers have given real world  problematic challenges to work through and solve with Python. 
    
    I consider myself an intermediate Python developer, and I feel I‚Äôve progressed past the need for the same old, basic lessons put forth in the majority of even the most premium tutorial apps currently available. I‚Äôm simply put off, or even deterred completely by a feeling of condescension that I realize isn‚Äôt intended.
     I feel i should assure those reading this, I‚Äôm not trashing competing development houses by saying this. Hopefully, respectfully ranting can assist in bringing to the table the sheer insanity in high monthly and annual subscription fees and the boredom of these basic course materials that , in my personal opinion, are not the business model with which one wins long term customers. Again, I have  an admiration for these other actors. It‚Äôs only constructive criticism is the natural selection that drives the evolution of any creative process and I feel patrons should be vocal in a productive manner.
    PythonX shows that learning to code (even the long since learned fundamentals) can be, and should be fun in practice and in practicing. I like what has been done here, and I hope to see consistently implemented updates and the addition of lessons and projects of varying difficulty in the future. 
   You have  succeeded in procuring a fan in a man admittedly difficult to please. Job well done! Please continue letting those fun and worthwhile ideas do great things for you and for us all!
