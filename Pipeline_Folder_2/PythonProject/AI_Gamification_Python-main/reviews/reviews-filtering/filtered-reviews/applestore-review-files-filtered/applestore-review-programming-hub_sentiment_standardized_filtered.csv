I want to help with the advancement of medicine. But, I thought that programming language was hard to understand, or complicated, with all those tags and everything. I‚Äôve tried some things. Did not work very well. So, I one day decided to browse through the App Store, bored, finding what could be right for me. But then, this app caught my very eye.

I thought that this app was another boring old app that is just like any other; repetitive, boring, and unteachable. But, I got it anyway, to see how it worked out. And do you want to know what I thought? This is actually fun and educational!

It breaks lessons thoroughly and easy. It gives you a mini lesson about that sub-lesson to that big lesson on this giant app. You guys made this app fun! I‚Äôm learning JavaScript, and it breaks it up step by step. No wonder it has so many 5 star ratings!

There is a little room for improvement. For example, where is intermediate? You go from beginner to advance. Where is that? There is no in between! Also, you could make more categories. It‚Äôs just tedious finding the course you want. Then, if you can‚Äôt find it, you have to search it, and what if you can‚Äôt remember the name! Please consider this as constructive feedback and not critical.

Anyways, back to the pros. Love the pictures to go along with it! It really helps with the research part if you wanna do apple or AI or C++ and so forth!

So, I love this app, and please make more!
Peace out-

However if you ARE GOING to pay MONTHLY INSTEAD Of annually or a lifetime cashout, then i *definitely recommend subscribing to something like ‚ÄúKnowin‚Äù 1st** since it is composed of much shorter & potentially easier courses that APPEAR to be designed as a prerequisite for completion before the purchase of something like this (in order to speed up the pace of completion when the duration has a direct affect on the cost per year etc.). 
*In general, it depends on personal priorities.. but when this opt was compared to the similar alternatives in the top charts, this one does come out a little a little bit longer per course, but the service provider does offer a ‚Äòlifetime‚Äô subscription option (which I selected in hopes they do not suddenly discontinue operations).

I mean in a metaphysical sense, this app ultimately has Bad intentions. 

Sure, it wears a Good mask with its wonderfully design mask that gives you a hug after its pleasantly displayed dialogue about what programming is (not how to do it), and sure, there seems to be a great deal of 34.99 for lifetime access so you won‚Äôt get billed ever again. That also seems Good. There‚Äôs a broad range of courses so you can learn *about* whatever you like. That also seems Good. 

And then you try to learn, which can only theoretically occur after we have finished the free ‚Äúwhat is Programming‚Äù lessons. There‚Äôs a reason for this, because the learning is literally clicking answers to a quiz, where you can always just change your answer and speed through. No *learning* takes place anywhere. No practical example. No code editor. No hint that we‚Äôre only here to learn about concepts, and pretty basic ones, from my C# experience. 

Would you have paid 34.95 for such a thing? Maybe you would have, but my thinking is you probably wanted to learn something instead of being hugged by your hand computer. 

Oh, maybe their c# class is only in development? Not according to other reviews here. 

Get this app if you want to relate to your children/grandchildren about what programming is, or maybe if you want to be a terrible CEO who ruins his company because he thinks he learned something. 

You lesson designers‚Ä¶ I know you understand. I know it‚Äôs the bizdev creature. They‚Äôre gonna do what they‚Äôre gonna do. 

I know it‚Äôs not your fault either, overworked marketing person who is probably underpaid as well. 

But this product‚Ä¶ and it is a product‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Bad. It hurts people by being deceptive more than it does by being ineffective, and it‚Äôs designed to do just that. That‚Äôs not Good, by whatever moral system you use. If it is considered good, I don‚Äôt know what to think of your higher power, man.",1,False,ahoymehearties,Not Good,NEGATIVE,app isnt good capital g fact think bad mean metaphysical sense app ultimately bad intentions sure wears good mask wonderfully design mask gives hug pleasantly displayed dialogue programming sure seems great deal 3499 lifetime access wont get billed ever also seems good theres broad range courses learn whatever like also seems good try learn theoretically occur finished free programming lessons theres reason learning literally clicking answers quiz always change answer speed learning takes place anywhere practical example code editor hint learn concepts pretty basic ones c experience would paid 3495 thing maybe would thinking probably wanted learn something instead hugged hand computer oh maybe c class development according reviews get app want relate childrengrandchildren programming maybe want terrible ceo ruins company thinks learned something lesson designers know understand know bizdev creature theyre gonna theyre gonna know fault either overworked marketing person probably underpaid well product product bad hurts people deceptive ineffective designed thats good whatever moral system use considered good dont know think higher power man,status quo sloth,person

Update 8/1 - I think the additional canned messages from the developer asking me to reach out to the customer service team, the one that‚Äôs not been fixing my issue for over a month and making the situation worse is telling.

But I have no intentions of jumping back onto that wheel of pain when it‚Äôs abundantly clear your agents have already attempted everything and refuse to simply escalate me at this point.
