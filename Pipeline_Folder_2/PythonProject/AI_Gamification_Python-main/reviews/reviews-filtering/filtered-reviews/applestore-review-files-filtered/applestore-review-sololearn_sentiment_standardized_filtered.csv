I hadn't even gotten through the third Javascript lesson yet before I got an alert saying that I'd run out of free practice.

I have an infant who wants to be held at all times (and doesn't seem to like my office chair), and a requirement to learn Javascript for my job, so an app is how I'm attempting to make both work.

1164,2020-09-05 16:06:48,"UPDATED REVIEW:
The developer seemed to have fixed whatever the ad issue was that I and several other reviewers pointed out. (Original review is below this one)

The only thing I find kind of odd is that the developer doesn’t actually publicly acknowledge the ad issue, just tells you to contact support. To what end? The issue is obvious?

Regardless of the obvious misstep by SoloLearn support in responding to reviews. As I stated in my original review, the app is quite good. I’ve used it a lot over the past several months and there’s a lot to like and it works fantastically as a means to support other more thorough learning methods (videos, books, mentors, etc.)

I definitely recommend the app as someone looking to add a mobile resource to their learning routine. 

My main suggestion to the developer is to give more time on the challenges and require the authors of the questions to add descriptions and explanations to help aid learning and not just offer competition. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The newest update added a pretty awful feature. 

Ads that can’t be closed or skipped. You sit there looking at the ad thinking it’ll close in 30 seconds or so like every other free app... but no, you can sit there until the zombie apocalypse, it will never close. 

So now I get to force close the app every time I complete a section.

The app so far is great– it's beginner friendly and very step by step, and you're able to look at solutions for practices when you're stumped. There are comment sections on the lessons where you can find helpful information from other users. 

My only problems would be that the ""challenge weapons"" (what code you can use for special challenges) do not include Kotlin, which is the main language I am learning. Many of the solutions for practices do not include what the lesson taught (for example, the Kotlin practice example for filtering arrays does not use that command, instead going for forEach.) They do work of course, but it isn't helpful to see what you did wrong in implementing what you learned. 

A minor problem is there is no way to contact support within the app itself. There is an email and a way to do it through the site, but I would appreciate there being one in the app as well. I haven't contacted support for this due to forgetting my login information (the main reason I would like support within the app) so take it with a grain of salt as there might be a solution, but I bought the annual pro subscription and have not been able to access some of the features promised– the main one being seeing past errors in your practices rather than having them being locked.

I forgot about this $65 subscription (after tax) & after seeing it in my bank statement (but playing with the app for a couple days), i realized this was an investment, not a mistake. 

Sololearn has quickly grown to become one of my most used apps on my phone & it’s not because of the extensive library of courses, not because of the ability to create an account & save your progress, not because of the ability to add, train, and compete with your friends. It’s mostly due to the comment section feature that has been added to each section/page of each lesson! I love the extra little ‘tips’ everyone has & all the motivation they give each other. 

I’d say this app has made it to stardom in my eyes simply for the classroom aspect of it all. it sure makes it feel like i’m in a class setting, knowing that I can filter the comments by most recent if needed, having multiple Pro teachers within that comment section also helps in situations where you can’t understand the lesson.

1459,2021-01-02 23:27:52,"Don’t trust the App Store Age Rating for this app. At the time of this review, it says “4+” but the SoloLearn Terms of Use clearly state:

“ if you are a child under thirteen (13), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information.”

The Play Store via Android gives an ESRB rating of Teen (“Users interact.”) “Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. [...]” which is a much more accurate assessment of age-appropriateness.

The Age Rating these marketplaces assign to its apps are not the fault of the app developers, so given a (truer) target audience of 13+, I think this app deserves 4 stars.

- Features great concepts which never seem to reach their full potential, no matter how many revisions the UI/UX seems to endure

1589,2018-11-25 06:12:42,"My computer’s been having issues lately, so being able to code on my iPad Pro has been very convenient. I’m a pretty novice programmer, so the tutorials for learning Java have helped me a lot. My favorite feature after the compiler is the challenges, which have helped me hone my skills and practice.

My only real complaint is that the Java compiler has a few bugs - less than other compilers I’ve tried, and they don’t interfere too much in terms of running, but they can make the code look messy. Firstly, if you open a parenthesis or brackets, a second one pops up closing it (which is great), but deleting the first before typing anything doesn’t delete the second, and if you add another parenthesis to close out of habit, it just adds another parentheses. Also, tabbing sometimes produces inconsistent distances, or tabs on the wrong line. On a related note, the default template that appears when you start a new editor uses small tabs, but most times when you tab in the document, it makes a big tabs. One more bug is that if you hit enter and quickly start typing, it sometimes rearranged the letters you type. Undoing with control-z doesn’t work either. Sorry if I didn’t explain these well, I can explain better if you need! These are using the first iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard, by the way.

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file.

1664,2018-04-14 22:06:10,"I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but there are a number of things that really bothered me about it when trying to learn C++ and test code snippets:

1. iOS’ loupe is broken in the code editor.  It places the caret where your thumb is pressing, instead of the center of the magnifying glass, so you can’t see exactly where it will be located.  This is especially frustrating because...
2. The editor automatically adds closing parentheses, brackets, braces, and double quotes after the caret.  This is an infuriating “feature” that I turn off in every environment I use, and I haven’t found a way to turn it off here.  Because of this, I must relocate the caret on nearly every line, which when combined with item 1 makes this app completely useless as a mobile coding environment.

Regarding the lessons themselves.

3. I understand that c++ throws so much more at you than most other languages when you first step into it, and you want to simplify as much as you can, but I strongly disagree with how much the lessons insist upon the line ""using namespace std;"", which I've since learned is pretty widely agreed upon as bad practice.  Beginners should absolutely be exposed to using std::cout instead of cout in the global namespace, as it also serves as a handy reminder that the system header <iostream> needs to be included.

4. There needs to be a better way to skip modules.  By the time I installed this app, I was already familiar with most of what was covered in Module 1, and mostly needed to understand pointers and classes, but because I didn't know about prefix vs postfix increment/decrement operators and got one quiz question wrong, I had to trudge through 20+ quizzes consisting of ""type ""a"" into this blank: __"".

One of the things I really appreciate is that it provides a hands on learning experience right from the start (and I learn best by doing).

SoloLearn also has a good community where you can ask questions about coding topics and get help on issues you have with your code. You can also compete with other coders in challenges.

I love this app and check it more than facebook!",5,False,A Capella singer,Great App to Start Learning How to Code!,,POSITIVE,started using app fundamental ideas code came game played using simplified code even completing full c course making simple codes things like math test game rock paper scissors one things really appreciate provides hands learning experience right start learn best sololearn also good community ask questions coding topics get help issues code also compete coders challenges love app check facebook,challenges,challeng
