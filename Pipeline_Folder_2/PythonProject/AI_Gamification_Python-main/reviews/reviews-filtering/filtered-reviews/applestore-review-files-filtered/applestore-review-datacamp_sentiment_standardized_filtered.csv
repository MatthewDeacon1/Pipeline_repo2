251,2020-05-18 23:22:54,"My experience with learning theories and working in the language learning and education field for 10+ years has helped me see what makes for effective learning. If you want to learn these languages, you need constant and spaced reviews. This app is essential. 

In terms put how the app functions-it works fabulously. Great functionality and user interface. The tracking feature helps you get momentum and track your work. 

I do wish the exercises were a little more challenging, meaning I wish they challenged users to recall and remember before providing answer choices. Multiple choice is how many review methods work. The problem is, when facing these questions and challenges in the real world you don’t have multiple choice. You want to strike a balance between stimulating reality and not making it to challenging. A good middle ground is asking users to think of what to do for a few moments before showing the options. The more the brain is working the more learning and recall is being reinforced. On the other hand, we often have a false sense of learning when we read over what we already know. It’s the feeling of reviewing but learners in that state aren’t really engaging or learning/remembering as much as they could. In the end you cannot make someone do this. They either just wait for the multiple choice to come through or choose whatever until they get it right. But still the app can help stimulate good learning practices; e.g. “challenge yourself!” Another practice that comes to mind is this: after getting a right answer there could be a follow up question - “how confidently did you know this? Swipe up for “very” down for “not that confident,” and if users swipe down it asks them to explain it out loud to themselves why it is true...something like that. 

Kaplan’s GMAT app also has a way of marking a red yellow or green on confidence and keeps the questions in the rotation differently.
