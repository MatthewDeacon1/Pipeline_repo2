Back then it was a great app, great value for money and I would of recommended it but, I've recently re downloaded it and started using it again and I have found that it's not as great as it once was. Most of the languages have been removed you are now just left with Python, Java script, HTML, CSS and SQL. the app used to have a lot more and covered the basics really well. This would of been fine if it was just to streamline and specialise the app to provide more quality content for the languages they do provide but this is not the case. I jumped into HTML to refresh my knowledge only to find it does even cover the very basics. its starts you of with how to code buttons in HTML which is fine but for a complete beginner is a very strange place to start. It doesn't take you through the boilerplate code anymore. they now have a course you can take to get you into the industry as a front stack web developer in 6 months which is great but the app now seems like more of a supplement/ learning aid for that course so self learning is not as much of a viable option anymore with this app. I would suggest using other free sources of information to learn coding if you don't have the money to invest in this app or course, then use it when you have a bit more knowledge. As of now I cannot fully recommend the app as there are now better alternatives for those who are absolute beginners or prefer to learn solo in their own time. if you want to pay for a more comprehensive course then things like linked in learning, Udemy and other video learning courses are better and YouTube is the best place to learn the basics and its free if you don't mind the adds.",2,48,3.63,2022-01-06 03:42:38,,,NEGATIVE,fist started using app 34 years ago stop due personal circumstances back great app great value money would recommended ive recently downloaded started using found great languages removed left python java script html css sql app used lot covered basics really well would fine streamline specialise app provide quality content languages provide case jumped html refresh knowledge find even cover basics starts code buttons html fine complete beginner strange place start doesnt take boilerplate code anymore course take get industry front stack web developer 6 months great app seems like supplement learning aid course self learning much viable option anymore app would suggest using free sources information learn coding dont money invest app course use bit knowledge cannot fully recommend app better alternatives absolute beginners prefer learn solo time want pay comprehensive course things like linked learning udemy video learning courses better youtube best place learn basics free dont mind adds,"boosters, status quo sloth","special, person"

Whole sections won't accept the correct answer, or let you pass until you find out the bug. I can get through typing the f-bomb as long as I click ""see solution"" then progress. Correct solution will let you pass? Lol no. What kind of sucker expects correct syntax or their money's worth. For the money they're charging, having a javascript course devolve into uselessness, and not even working at all on Bluestacks, and working terribly on native android is disgraceful. Pros: attractive interface, enjoyable enough to use and probably good for total beginners who find programming daunting and are in a time crunch or hobbyists. If you learn well by rote this may help. Cons: That's all it is. Rote. You can parrot the answers because you answer the same question 50 times but do you really understand it on a deep level? Probably not. For the price I expect a full version in-browser or on Windows, especially now Bluestacks has failed me it is of no use to me on Android devices. The options to choose to answer with semicolon, comma etc are far too small and an accessibility nightmare. Buggy at times and rolls back on mini-lesson you just completed on a semi-regular basis (on both native Android device and Bluestacks) and update as I said the bugs are disgraceful. I'd hang my head releasing this for money As someone already proficient in HTML and CSS and some JS this is going to introduce you to basics and concepts. The jump from this to real world programming is going to be huge for a lot of people and I would say almost too steep - so just be aware of that and dont give up. You will need to move on the edx, Udemy or MS Learn to start more advanced problem solving and/or a lot of practice for real world application. You migh be able to read (some) code but writing your more advanced code is going to be beyond you without major further education imho. W3C schools is also your friend. The CSS section is far too basic and missing a lot of the better features of CSS3. HTML is also missing many elements and concepts - no site layout was properly covered. Judging by reviews, a lot of people are not even aware of this fact. You barely scratched the surface. Know this going in. It's a starting bite only. I want to love this. I like the concept, I like the design and I do enjoy it but I think for the price I expect better. I also echo the sentiment that review features are absolutely necessary to refresh and reinforce.

I did find the questions to be a little irritating because, like DuoLingo, there is no real lesson; it just has you learn through trial and error explaining only the bare minimum. In teaching lingo, it lacks some of the scaffolding needed to truly learn a topic. Still, I was interested. I was slightly bothered that it required accessing my email address even though I signed up through facebook. Why? Are you going to distribute my email to other parties? Then, in the second lesson, it wanted a rating already. I thought it was pretty early to ask that and was annoyed but snoozed it. I at least wanted to try two lessons before rating, especially since the first lesson was extremely short and I did not actually learn much. I went to continue on to a second lesson and it was locked. I realize you have to pay for a second lesson. Basically, the app is not free. You get one lesson per topic as a trial, but there is no free version of this app. So I'm irritated because I wasn't looking for a paid app. On top of it, the trial was not sufficient to test the product. Offer one whole section of real content for beginners and nothing else. Don't offer one short mini lesson on each. Additionally, a monthly subscription is a steep ask for an app like this. Once you buy a tutorial, you should own it to review it later. Still, all of these things being said, I pursued a second track and completed the first lesson. Command Line. It was actually really confusing. Not building blocks. Just threw you right in, again like DuoLingo for those who have used it. Trial by fire. I thought, maybe it's just command line. I added the Java track. I got two pages in and was totally lost. In fact it seemed to need additional software to complete the screen. I was beyond irritated. I decided to rate the app and delete it. I will also be removing permissions to access my email.",2,2,1.1.7,2018-10-13 21:42:22,,,NEGATIVE,initially liked app seemed like going super helpful find questions little irritating like duolingo real lesson learn trial error explaining bare minimum teaching lingo lacks scaffolding needed truly learn topic still interested slightly bothered required accessing email address even though signed facebook going distribute email parties second lesson wanted rating already thought pretty early ask annoyed snoozed least wanted try two lessons rating especially since first lesson extremely short actually learn much went continue second lesson locked realize pay second lesson basically app free get one lesson per topic trial free version app im irritated wasnt looking paid app top trial sufficient test product offer one whole section real content beginners nothing else dont offer one short mini lesson additionally monthly subscription steep ask app like buy tutorial review later still things said pursued second track completed first lesson command line actually really confusing building blocks threw right like duolingo used trial fire thought maybe command line added java track got two pages totally lost fact seemed need additional software complete screen beyond irritated decided rate app delete also removing permissions access email,boosters,special

So far it seems ok but there's still bugs and I'm not sure that you will be able to write your own code by the end of it but I will update this again after I use it more and decide then. Until then, the devs are helpful and will respond to you. They mentioned adding more free content in future releases. I personally was not sold after the first 2 lessons and recommended they allow more than 2 free lessons. Again though, the app is still being developed, I hope to see a lot of improvements and I will keep this updated. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UPDATE: I have noticed in the ""loop"" section of the java course when ordering the code to display the factorial of 10 it constantly says you are wrong and does not let you continue. I have sent 2 emails but have recieved no replies yet. As for this I am contemplating on canceling my membership. You also need to add a Q&A in each course. Thank you. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NEWEST UPDATE: I am no longer using this app. No, you will not know a language well enough to code on your own, the developers have quit replying to emails. I've sent over 4 now.. The teaching methods are not well at all, there is no help area for those who have questions over an area you are learning as well and seeing how the dev's don't reply now you will be stuck. This seems to be more for money and not to actually help you learn a language. ""Sololearn"" is free and has so much more information and better teaching methods. If you get stuck in a course on MIMO then you might as well cancel your membership because you won't get passed and you also won't get help. (I figured out everything but was stumped a few times do to errors, I have finished complete courses). After the courses are complete you will still not have the knowledge you desire, you won't be able to write your own code. Don't give in to this app, it isn't worth it.",2,17,1.1.6,2018-10-11 02:30:44,"Hi Colton!
