It was sad to see that not only are a lot of the lessons out of order, but also inaccurate. For example, the operator precedence lesson for Python indicates that all boolean operators have equal precedence, when in reality they do NOT have equal precedence (Sololearn, I challenge you to go check the Python documentation and compare it to the erroneous guide you all posted). From greatest to least greatest precedence, the boolean operators should be ordered as: Not, And, Or. Fortunately, there are public comments for every single slide, so a lot of confusion is mitigated via these, but overall I can probably point out at least 5 to 10 other spots where a beginner would get easily confused by these lessons. If you want to truly learn programming, grab yourself a real, physical book, with legit examples and thorough explanations. It really doesn't cost that much...you'll thank not just me, but yourself later. Please thumbs up this review so that others striving to learn programming make the first step in the right direction as well - a physical book with proper lessons, not these terribly ordered quick concept cards occasionally sprinkled with misleading information.",2,10,2.3.1,2018-09-06 18:27:12,"Thanks for your report.

The code playground is great for testing code on android. The small size of this program is a huge bonus as well. The comments on the tutorials are very helpful. However as far as learning different languages the tutorials could use some work. The examples are to short to few to grasp concepts without having to use other resources to understand them. Often times the answers they ask you after each tutorial can be completely unrelated to the current tutorial.  All of this review is based off completion of one language (Java). I will likely edit my review once I have more time with this app. Oh and before I forget the app asking me for a review several times before I finish a tutorial is slightly annoying. This may seem like a negative review but overall I must say I am very pleased with this app. I just wanted to give some positive criticism so hopefully some of these issues can be addressed.  7/3/17 - After a few months of using this app I felt like an update to my review was appropriate. Some of my previous issues with the app still apply most don't, for example it still asks me to review the app in the middle of tutorials. But that is such a minor annoyance compared to everything this app has taught me. The courses I talked about on my previous review about unrelated tutorial questions isn't so bad now since they keep adding new things to the tutorials and adding new tutorials too! With all that being said this app deserves more than the 5 stars I can give it.

Very well organized content, both in terms of how the notions are presented, and interactivity by inserting mini-tests throughout every chapter.  Important to mention here is the ""try-it yourself"" code module, which allows users to write their own code.  Then, the comments section, in which one can read other people opinions and write their own comments and questions. And the challenge-tests, they are both fun and instructive.  Then, I believe the ""incentive"" system with points, badges, etc is very well thought, to motivate the person who is learning. It is also very useful that it is one single app that integrates all the courses, instead of having separate apps for java, html, css etc. Though the level of the notions presented in these courses is far from being called advanced or comprehensive, the app does a very good job at initiating one in html, css, java, sql, etc. After one completes a course in SoloLearn, will be much easier to read and *understand* online documentation.

Especially when you're on the go. I gave this 3 stars due to the fact that I feel some things are not thoroughly explained and some of the choices for variable use in code examples can be incredibly confusing. I have put a great deal of time into the Python course which is excellent. (However, the Python course is the worst I have seen about confusing variables, for instance instead of showing or explaining where a var was assigned. And instead of using an obvious variable name like x or y, they will sometimes use a word that to the uneducated could easily be a function or module or who knows. Which leaves you setting staring at a small piece of code trying to figure where this new word came from what its purpose is.) I also started and almost finished HTML. I cant say I am as impressed with it. I feel most of it is not thoroughly explained. Most of the excercises and quizzes can be done without reading a single word of the course as they are all fill in the blank type questions that can easily be solved by just paying attention to the  opposite (opening or closing) tag. So even though I have completed a large majority of the course, I feel as though I have grasped only the basic idea behind HTML. I feel the HTML course really could use a redesign as its just not currently designed to make the information stick in your memory as a course on anything should be.   Something else I feel would be absolutely invaluable to this app is a way to see how code is executed and in what order. Just something that shows each step the execution goes through and lets you go back and forth at your own pace. This would be excellent for helping to understand the order of precedence as well as simply putting a lot of the example snippets into perspective rather than making you set there trying to work out a puzzle in your head. Something else that would also be invaluable  to this app is suggesting excercises that will coincide with each lesson and will require you to use things in that lesson multiple times. For instance create a guess the number game in Python when learning to use range as well as getting user input. Not only would suggesting excercises help thoroughly cement lessons in your memory, but they would also show where different things are needed/useful. Its very easy to find yourself wanting to overlook things because they dont seem immediately useful to you.  Hope this gets the attention of the devs. I want to give this 5 stars.. but it could be much better.",3,0,1.3.3,2017-05-31 04:59:09,,,POSITIVE,love app excellent learning tool especially youre go gave 3 stars due fact feel things thoroughly explained choices variable use code examples incredibly confusing put great deal time python course excellent however python course worst seen confusing variables instance instead showing explaining var assigned instead using obvious variable name like x sometimes use word uneducated could easily function module knows leaves setting staring small piece code trying figure new word came purpose also started almost finished html cant say impressed feel thoroughly explained excercises quizzes done without reading single word course fill blank type questions easily solved paying attention opposite opening closing tag even though completed large majority course feel though grasped basic idea behind html feel html course really could use redesign currently designed make information stick memory course anything something else feel would absolutely invaluable app way see code executed order something shows step execution goes lets go back forth pace would excellent helping understand order precedence well simply putting lot example snippets perspective rather making set trying work puzzle head something else would also invaluable app suggesting excercises coincide lesson require use things lesson multiple times instance create guess number game python learning use range well getting user input would suggesting excercises help thoroughly cement lessons memory would also show different things neededuseful easy find wanting overlook things dont seem immediately useful hope gets attention devs want give 5 stars could much better,boosters,special
