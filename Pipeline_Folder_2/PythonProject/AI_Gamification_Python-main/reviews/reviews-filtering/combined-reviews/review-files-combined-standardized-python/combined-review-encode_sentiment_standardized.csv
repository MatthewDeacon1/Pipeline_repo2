The description says it is POWERED by JavaScript  (which is both obsolete and just overall regarded as one of the worst languages in the coding community) and does not actually specify how to implement any of the code, how to run it, or again, what language. Does it need a compiler? Does it need an IDE? Does it run in a virtual machine like Java or on the hardware like C++? I have so many qustions, but there's nothing to indicate anything. Now, if it's all in the paid version, that's just low. Teach a person a language they can't use. Though, the Web section did save the app two stars. That was a lot more straight forward. Overall the UI looked good. But there's just so much missing that leaves the user who actually wants to use the language for something unsure of everything. They know a language, but not the name, or in what cases you should use it. Also, I feel ""this is a string. A string is letters in quotations"" is not the best way to teach. Maybe explain when it's used. I mean, I already know what a strong is because of my background in c++ and python and java, but people that are seeking a skill they have no experience with, they probably won't know a great deal.
