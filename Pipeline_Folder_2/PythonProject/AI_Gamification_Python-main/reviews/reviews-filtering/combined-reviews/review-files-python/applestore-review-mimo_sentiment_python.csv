The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a “lives system” like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don’t go premium. Once you run out it’s roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning. This has been the best experience I have ever had in my journey to learn how to program. Between the textbooks and other online courses, this is hands down my favorite experience.",5,False,BreadOne2Three,… And it’s all free,POSITIVE,python

Oh you one without wisdom. I have seen the light; I have been enlightened.” All that Mimo gives so freely couldn’t have been conceived in my wildest visions. Mimo... is like  heaven come to earth. It’s sleek design, a satisfying ui and, dare I say, Mimolicios leaderboard has inspired me each and every day to expand my brain capacity.  The Mimo experience; a hill with flowers atop, a place to call home, a place to call school. I have climbed passed my “peers”, with my intellectual prowess, easily shooting to the top of every leaderboard in my sight. I feel like a child, touching the face of God as my eyes are opened. This is what it all means. I feel like the summarians, national  superpowers that saw what the human capacity currently was, and didn’t except it: no, they rebelled against there primitive form and invented the basis for the advances we are able to make today. As I sit here, wrighting this reflection of the greatest peece of the puzzle that is our human experience: I reflect apon my life before Mimo, the melancholy state I was in. I don’t shame those who are experiencing a similar way of living; no, I call them, I offer them a hand  out of the dusty, well trodden rode they are crouched on, and say: “let me offer you something greater, something inspiring and powerful: let me grant you Mimo.”

When you tell people not to use our app, you're turning people away who might benefit a lot because traditional textbooks aren't their style of learning. Thanks for your feedback, The Mimo Team"", 'modified': '2018-08-14T13:24:45Z'}","I got this app because it was featured in the App Store, when I saw it I said to myself “Hey! This looks cool, might be better then the book I have for coding with python considering it has a IOS section”,but as soon as I get started I am asked to pay money to continue on, all they have is ONE free lesson in the IOS section, ONE! And I am pretty sure that applies to the other learning sections as well, so please don’t even bother with this app, get a book for coding, it’s wayyy cheaper and more informational then any app.",1,False,Sniperboss207,"Please don’t use this app, don’t even bother with it",NEGATIVE,python
