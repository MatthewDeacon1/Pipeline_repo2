But despite having some rudimentary knowledge of several different coding languages, I find myself confused and befuddled by their python lessons. This really can’t be used by beginners. (Not to mention, there are some obvious grammar errors that need to be cleaned up.) As a free app, it’s fine. The frustration is worth it for the knowledge. But as a paid app, it needs to be smoothed out and proofed to be worth the money.",3,False,Ciavyn2,Not for beginners,,NEGATIVE,python

Before I started using encode, I was not interested in coding and thought it to be very tedious. However, after encode I am addicted to python and complete four or five units a day. After python I plan to look the java script and css/html courses encode has. Amazing!! I totally recommend this app!",5,False,NarutoUzamaki787,Into the coding verse,,POSITIVE,python

168,2019-07-08 14:36:20,"I was really enjoying encode and how you could play with the interpreter in the previous version and i was learning a lot. I even purchased the pro version! It was helping me to learn the syntax by allowing me to type in the full code myself and play around with it.
With the recent update “refresh” to Knowin,  it doesn’t feel interactive. I don’t feel like I’m using a python interpreter.
I can’t edit the code to try to understand a certain piece of syntax or play around.

It looks nice. But I am absolutely not happy with this update. I’m let down because I was learning so much before.
I’m not going to be using the app until this is fixed (if it gets fixed)
it just feels too much like I’m taking a guided tour through a window now without much interactivity.",2,False,GravyT,Not learning much since recent update to Knowin.,,NEGATIVE,python
