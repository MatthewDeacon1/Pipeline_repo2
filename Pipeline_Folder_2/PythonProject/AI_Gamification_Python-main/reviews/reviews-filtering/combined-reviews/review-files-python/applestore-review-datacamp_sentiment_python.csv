Honestly everyone I know should download this app because it doesn‚Äôt just accurately teach you python it also brings you knowledge, I love how there is no pop up ads or a load of them speaking of that. And I would love to thank everyone who worked on data camp and helped me and others. Good job guys on making this wonderful game and thank you for putting you knowledge to make this experience. Lastly this is my first review I have ever written in the AppStore and I really think y‚Äôall are special.

11,2022-06-04 03:35:37,"I‚Äôve been pretty impressed with this app. After learning the basics I was looking for an app to help me learn intermediate python. I ended up taking the beginners python since it was more comprehensive than what I used to learn python originally. The instructor videos don‚Äôt bring it to K12 level, but they certainly don‚Äôt talk over your head. They do a great job explaining tricky concepts in a way that makes it straightforward to try on your own. Would definitely recommend DataCamp - I even became a paid member. ü§ôüèºüòé",5,False,OhhRyan303,Accessible and Comprehensive,,POSITIVE,python
23,2020-09-14 22:15:24,"Videos and interface is very intuitive. They teach you from scratch or from any level you‚Äôre already at. A lot of courses to choose from and an active community on slack that you can collaborate with and get help from. Compared to other sites/apps like this, datacamp tends to have more practice than other places and that‚Äôs why I picked it. They‚Äôve delivered so far and I just finished the intro to python.",5,False,raj fs,Awesome! Worth it.,,POSITIVE,python
28,2021-07-22 19:53:24,The videos/lessons are pretty similar to the computer version. Although I have noticed that lessons that I am working on are not showing up in the app and there‚Äôs no way to search for your lesson. Also when yo use etc a ‚Äòtrack‚Äô it doesn‚Äôt let you change...

31,2019-09-04 20:27:58,"For some reason I clicked with this app more than others. Was using sololearn for a long time but, I‚Äôve learned a lot more about python basics through DataCamp better than any other coding app so far. The difference was the retention, the way the questions are worded, and how the information is formatted. Better all around than other apps I‚Äôve used to learn python.",5,False,Tyler53121,Vs. other apps,,POSITIVE,python
32,2020-07-21 16:46:22,I am a PhD student in Earth and Environmental Sciences and this app was fundamental to me learning python. The beginner lessons are very well done and accessible to all!

35,2020-07-09 02:07:30,"I have used a couple of other programs to learn Python and while they laid a solid base, DataCamp just jumped into the things that I was the most interested to learn (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.). After going through the beginner and intermediate python and R courses, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning about how to become a data scientist.",5,False,Will.I.Am4112,Great program!,,POSITIVE,python
37,2019-11-27 23:13:28,"Excellent supplemental or foundational tool to learn python for novice and intermediate level student. Really well thought out lectures and questions.

I came across DataCamp and tried the free modules to fill in the gaps of my patched together learning.

333,2019-03-26 01:36:57,"DataCamp on iPad can help folks learn and practice programming concepts. It does it in a way that lets the user figure stuff out.

This helps me practice concepts I‚Äôm learning in my CS classes.

I‚Äôve got R, SQL and Python classes on DataCamp. It helps me practice skills. Also, just reading code and figuring out what it‚Äôs doing is helping me in my algorithms class where we are using python.
