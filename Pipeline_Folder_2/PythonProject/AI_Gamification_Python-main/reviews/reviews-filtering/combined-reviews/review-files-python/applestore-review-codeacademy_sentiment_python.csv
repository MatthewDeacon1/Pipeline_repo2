I mostly got my gpa from this app because since I got this app I’ve been getting straight 4’s(A+) thanks

The content in the python module is good so far, but the app itself makes the content useless because it won’t refresh, update progress, or even add a course when you select “start this course.”",2,False,Ironically Buggy for an App that Teaches Coding,ncpck,NEGATIVE,python

389,2021-10-26 23:04:22,"I quote you guys “I mean pacifically those looking to learn any skills pertaining to the field software engineering and/or development a.k.a. “holding “which is a generalised vague summation of software development…I never understood the whole “learn to code” nonsense— because, “coding” in its broadest sense is nothing more than the execution of software…by that definition; anyone capable of running the following function in an IDE is a “coder”…

print(‘Hello world’)

Grats!

When I first began learning software development, resources were limited to books and websites with personal blogs…before smart phones, using Windows ‘99.

 I recently began ‘learning to code’ (I get some more accurate explanation would be remembering to code whilst learning about what’s changed in almost 15Y— i’ll admit it was a bit intimidating at first until I realise that just like always (at least when it comes to engineering/tech )Evolution is based in its simplest user friendly experience and so the UX/UI would be easy after a decade and a half of pivoting to finance for the 2nd half of my 20s. My goodness was I right.

I don’t know how to say this but python is a joke. In either case, I’ve returned to home my craft and I am blessed with a bittersweet life.

I grew up with crippling OCD/autism/ADHD and so the syntax and indentation that really bugs most developers was something I actually enjoy it and C++/CSS.

I am/was uniquely poised for this whole fintech/crypto revolution—Needless to say there were NOT many people that have an educational tantamount to an MBA in finance and Master’s computer science which is exactly what you need to fully understand fintech. I feel really stupid for paying 300 something bucks for annual subscription at DataCamp when FCC is more than enough in terms of educational resources in Data science/data analysis/machine learning/etc. 

From a former MIT grad: shout-out to the devs at FCC for expediting access to your personal resources, fundamentals and exercises. At this rate I should be up to speed by the end of the quarter! Thanks to ya’ll!

I try refreshing the app and repeating the same questions I got wrong to reach the end of the lesson and go to the next, and it still doesn’t load fully. It irritates me how I’m really trying to learn how to code on the go, for a school club of mines while I don’t have access to a computer all the time when I’m not home, and I have to deal with this problem.
