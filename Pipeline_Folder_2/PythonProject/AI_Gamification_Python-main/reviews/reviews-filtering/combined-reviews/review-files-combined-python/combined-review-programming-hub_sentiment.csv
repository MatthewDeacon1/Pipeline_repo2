I made the mistake of paying for it based on reviews. I've looked at a few courses so far and both have wrong answers in their ""tests"" This is a total waste of money unless you want very rudimentary knowlege. If you are actually looking for something to teach you a language this is not it. It uses terms way too generally. Programming requires knowledge of which type of bracketing is required () vs {} vs [] etc. it does not properly distinguish which it is referencing in text. Example one question in the python course states ""If we want to display anything on the screen it needs to be written inside brackets and enclosed within double quotes "" ""."" True or False, The proper answer to me would be false, as the general idea I understand for Brackets is [ ] not parenthesis also you can use single or double quotes...
