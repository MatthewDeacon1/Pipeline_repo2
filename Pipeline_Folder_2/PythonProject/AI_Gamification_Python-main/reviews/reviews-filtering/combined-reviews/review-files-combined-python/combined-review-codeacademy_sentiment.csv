print(‚ÄòHello world‚Äô)

Grats!

When I first began learning software development, resources were limited to books and websites with personal blogs‚Ä¶before smart phones, using Windows ‚Äò99.

 I recently began ‚Äòlearning to code‚Äô (I get some more accurate explanation would be remembering to code whilst learning about what‚Äôs changed in almost 15Y‚Äî i‚Äôll admit it was a bit intimidating at first until I realise that just like always (at least when it comes to engineering/tech )Evolution is based in its simplest user friendly experience and so the UX/UI would be easy after a decade and a half of pivoting to finance for the 2nd half of my 20s. My goodness was I right.

I don‚Äôt know how to say this but python is a joke. In either case, I‚Äôve returned to home my craft and I am blessed with a bittersweet life.

I grew up with crippling OCD/autism/ADHD and so the syntax and indentation that really bugs most developers was something I actually enjoy it and C++/CSS.

I am/was uniquely poised for this whole fintech/crypto revolution‚ÄîNeedless to say there were NOT many people that have an educational tantamount to an MBA in finance and Master‚Äôs computer science which is exactly what you need to fully understand fintech. I feel really stupid for paying 300 something bucks for annual subscription at DataCamp when FCC is more than enough in terms of educational resources in Data science/data analysis/machine learning/etc. 

From a former MIT grad: shout-out to the devs at FCC for expediting access to your personal resources, fundamentals and exercises. At this rate I should be up to speed by the end of the quarter! Thanks to ya‚Äôll!
