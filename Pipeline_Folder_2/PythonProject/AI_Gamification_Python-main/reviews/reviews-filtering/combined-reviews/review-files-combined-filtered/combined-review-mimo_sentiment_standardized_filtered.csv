The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a “lives system” like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don’t go premium. Once you run out it’s roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning. This has been the best experience I have ever had in my journey to learn how to program.

Also, questions are way too easy, or too hard because of wording. Getting a question wrong usually attributed to poor grammar in the question (it’s incredibly important to hire a native English speaker to review all material before publishing it), then action required to submit the correct answer requires back tracking, dispute the visibility of the existing multiple choice widgets appearing to still be tappable. 

It’s ok learning web dev from this app but I don’t think the Duolingo approach necessarily works well.

878,878,878,2022-04-28 00:14:47,,"This app is very helpful for grasping and visualizing the basics of programming. I love the mini apps it walks you through along the way because most of my discouragement while learning programming has been “okay… I know what this does… but what do I use it for?” Lol. The leader boards add a nice competitive touch that keep me engaged as well. The only negative thing I would say is that there can be an awful lot of hand-holding, even when you’re further into a topic. For example I was just going through comparisons in JavaScript and it spent several pages telling me how a greater-than (>) operator checks to see if one value is greater than another. But on the final page the instructions were “check if this number is greater than another *by typing >*”. Personally I feel like it’s harder to lock those ideas in because you don’t really have to. The instructions tell you exactly what you need to pass, and if you get an answer wrong it immediately corrects you by telling you the right thing to type. In one sense I understand you don’t want to make it too hard for beginners. But in another it almost feels like it removes the necessity for me to access my own memory and solve the problem myself. Like if I was learning math and something said, “Solve 5+5 by typing 10.” It feels disappointing at times because I’m thinking, “We’ll shoot. I would have liked to initiate my own brain resources to figure that out, but I’ve accidentally glanced at the answer by reading the question.” Lol. However, it should be noted that at later modules it does pull back and let you work things out by yourself a little more. So it’s not a COMPLETELY overbearing teacher. 

BESIDES that possibly minor nit-pick though, I really love this app. I’ve tried a few others and they don’t feel nearly as engaging. They tend to fall on the other side of the spectrum where they either just leave you hanging without much clue what to do. Or there’s no interactivity and it’s just strictly multiple choice questions. This app actually has you type things out (or select from predefined options, which is easier to handle on mobile).

1093,1093,1093,2020-08-16 08:04:11,,"(Be ready for a long review :)) 
 I have used this app for a while now and although I really love this app, the biggest problem is the hearts/lives. I wish that there would be either more lives, or lives that come back quicker. The lives take too long to return (4 hours/heart) and it discourages me a little. Sometimes I would accidentally pick the wrong choice or have a typo (as there is no autocorrect in coding) and poof, a heart is gone. 
The hearts are the biggest flaw but here are some of the minor flaws...the instructions and friend invites. I don’t know if it’s just me, but sometimes a question is unclear and I have to really think about what the right answer is. And because the hearts take a long time to return, when I only have one heart left, I just end up quitting the lesson and choosing a different one. Second is the friend invites. Recently, I found out that you can invite friends to earn a free week of pro so I sent out a couple of invites. I had one friend sign up for Mimo and it shows up that I have seven days of Mimo pro but my account is still in the free version.

They have introductory lessons of learning, but I will provide an update in my response. I am really loving this app due to the fact that I personally practiced Python in the past, but seemed to have issues remembering some aspects to properly complete a working program that functions without syntax errors. As I have been doing the lessons, it is all coming back.

I am VERY curious of whether they intend on adding more languages into this application, as it is very resourceful. I’m excited to see the development of this app!

The only complaint I have is that they offered a 50% discount for the pro version due to the current hardships of some people face during current events. I wanted to see if it was worth it before making the purchase, however it took a few days to get past a few lessons and realize that this application is an asset. Now the offer previously offered is no longer available… I wish I could have taken advantage of this opportunity, however it has expired before I realized the potential.

1298,1298,1298,2020-06-17 09:07:17,,"I’ll preface this review with a fact about me; I rarely write reviews. It takes a lot for something to either wow me enough or disappoint me enough to leave a review. In the case of Mimo, it frankly has knocked my socks off! 

I’m using Mimo alongside precourse material for my upcoming bootcamp and honestly, it’s providing more information in a more accessible format. Everything is explained very well and delivered in a way that just clicks with how I learn. 

You’re also given the opportunity to really drill the information into your head by maxing out the stars. It can be a bit repetitive to do this but I actually think that’s a good thing; once I get annoyed with covering the same thing over and over I know I’ve got the knowledge. 

I’m always a bit hesitant with app based learning programs because I always feel like I’m going to get to the point where I want to learn more and then they’ll tell me that I need to upgrade. That’s not the case with Mimo! The free version is very robust and has all of the information on HTML, CSS, and JS that you need to get started. The only thing I can see that would require a membership is the projects which, while great, aren’t necessary to learn the information; mainly just practice. 

Unfortunately, I was planning on learning the material first and then tackling the projects but my discounted pro price expired. It’s all good though, as I said, the free version is great! There’s a small ad at the end of each lesson but they’re very easy to click out of and only last a couple of seconds. 

The only thing I’d like to see from Mimo is an option to access the lessons from a computer. Obviously, I’m not going to be doing web dev on my phone so it would be nice to get the practice in on desktop. Projects are available on desktop though so if I decide to spring for a pro subscription I will be taking advantage of that. 

I’ll end this with a thank you to Mimo for providing this amazing service! If you’re thinking about trying this app, absolutely go for it!

1331,1331,1331,2021-06-10 23:11:28,,"If you’re looking for a free learning app, I can’t suggest this one unless the heart system gets reworked. Basically you have 5 hearts and lose 1 every time you get an answer wrong. You can get your hearts back but it takes 4 hours each. 1 at a time.

Aside from this, it would be a 5 star app. I love everything else about it.

Basically there comes a time where you might need to wait at least 4 hours to continue learning. That’s right, you’re not allowed to learn when you want to unless you pay or just go start over on another free app that doesn’t do this. Oh and I say at least 4 hours because if you lose all of your hearts, you might want to wait until you have 2 hearts for padding before you try again. Falling to 0 hearts means you may have to start your lesson over. The lessons are short, but it’s frustrating.

So how easy is it to lose hearts?

Okay so I accidentally wrote “poo()” instead of “pop().” A funny mistake, but I lost a heart. Next I was following instructions on something and it didn’t tell me if I should add the curly brackets yet or not. Well apparently not, and I lost a heart even though the curly brackets were supposed to go there. Mimo just didn’t want me to add them yet. Another time I actually wrote the correct answer and it failed me and told me to write the same thing.

1375,1375,1375,2020-05-21 22:12:53,,"I came to Mimo as an absolute novice when it comes to coding. I had minimal experience with HTML and no experience whatsoever with any other coding languages. At first, I found the lessons fun and engaging, and within a couple of weeks I felt like I had a decent understanding of the basic mechanics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These principals are taught in bite-sized lessons, similar in structure to Duolingo. Two things the program does really well is providing side projects that allow you to apply your knowledge and skill challenges that allow you to test your understanding of the material. This is what drew me in initially.  

However, when I tried to dive deeper into some of the other lessons Mimo has to offer, I was incredibly disappointed by how shallow the material was. Their Python course, for example, is only spread out over 11 lessons, and there are none of the aforementioned skill challenges or side projects that allow you to solidify your knowledge. I had the same experience when trying to learn C#. It seems that they’ve put quite a bit of work into HTML, CSS, and JS, but not nearly enough into their other offerings. 

They have a system in place where you can repeat a lesson three times (which I only learned by contacting tech support - nowhere in the app does it tell you this), with each level supposedly being more difficult than the last. Except they’re not more difficult - it’s mostly just the same info, over and over again. Half of the questions tell you exactly what to do, so it feels more like rote repetition than actual learning. Overall, I get the sense that Mimo’s marketing strategy is to make it seem as though they offer more material than they actually do, and to stretch that information over as many units as they possibly can. 

I paid for a month of Pro, which I don’t regret. I got a lot out of this month of learning. But I feel like I’ve already hit a wall with what this app can offer me, and I don’t think I’ll be renewing.

Honestly I bet that may be a flaw and a cause for people to leave the app as soon as they get it. 
A suggestion for this would be maybe look at letting users do higher levels, but without a subscription put the it on a time limit. If funding is that big of an issue, I don’t really know how well newer users will do. For example:

Letting users unlock all the levels, however. For every activity (getting started, etc.) have an extended wait until they could do the next level (30 mins, 3 hrs, 1 day, etc.). This way users would still be pushed to get a subscription, but can still access and enjoy the app. Also, maybe insert adds in-between lessons for non-subscriptions, or you could even put the option of using adds to shorten the wait time by a bit. 

That being said, the app in itself looks really great! Which is why I give it four stars, it’s just the fact that you need at LEAST a $10 subscription to go past the first level of any course that I wouldn’t really recommend it yet.

I love the concept of this app and a lot of things are made quite clear and concise through the lessons. I found the introduction to hacking very straightforward. However, I see a _lot_ of mistakes in the lessons, especially typos or missing words in the exercises, which sometimes makes it unclear what the exercise is actually even about. I’ve been trying to report these kinds of things but have so far received no indication that my reports have even been received. I was also a bit disappointed by the need to pay $50/year in order to do just about anything in the app. You really should give a more in-depth preview before you force people to pay. Also, if you already have programming experience, it’s unclear if you can skip ahead to more advanced topics. Maybe the target audience is only complete beginners, but if that’s the case then the $50/year is _definitely_ not worth it. Also, as sort of a side note, the update notes here on the App Store are bugged out. How can you not have noticed that???

Please extend your preview, fix your errors, lower the cost, and add content for more advanced users. I don’t think you want people to feel like they’re being scammed.

Back then it was a great app, great value for money and I would of recommended it but, I've recently re downloaded it and started using it again and I have found that it's not as great as it once was. Most of the languages have been removed you are now just left with Python, Java script, HTML, CSS and SQL. the app used to have a lot more and covered the basics really well. This would of been fine if it was just to streamline and specialise the app to provide more quality content for the languages they do provide but this is not the case. I jumped into HTML to refresh my knowledge only to find it does even cover the very basics. its starts you of with how to code buttons in HTML which is fine but for a complete beginner is a very strange place to start. It doesn't take you through the boilerplate code anymore. they now have a course you can take to get you into the industry as a front stack web developer in 6 months which is great but the app now seems like more of a supplement/ learning aid for that course so self learning is not as much of a viable option anymore with this app. I would suggest using other free sources of information to learn coding if you don't have the money to invest in this app or course, then use it when you have a bit more knowledge. As of now I cannot fully recommend the app as there are now better alternatives for those who are absolute beginners or prefer to learn solo in their own time. if you want to pay for a more comprehensive course then things like linked in learning, Udemy and other video learning courses are better and YouTube is the best place to learn the basics and its free if you don't mind the adds.",2,,Ezras Adams,,NEGATIVE,2960ce0d-640d-4f3c-8657-0976226c0b4b,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5R5teF-IZeA0lvoBWeSb-BfW3qGM9DGqNfYxDYaQ9o,48.0,3.63,,,fist started using app 34 years ago stop due personal circumstances back great app great value money would recommended ive recently downloaded started using found great languages removed left python java script html css sql app used lot covered basics really well would fine streamline specialise app provide quality content languages provide case jumped html refresh knowledge find even cover basics starts code buttons html fine complete beginner strange place start doesnt take boilerplate code anymore course take get industry front stack web developer 6 months great app seems like supplement learning aid course self learning much viable option anymore app would suggest using free sources information learn coding dont money invest app course use bit knowledge cannot fully recommend app better alternatives absolute beginners prefer learn solo time want pay comprehensive course things like linked learning udemy video learning courses better youtube best place learn basics free dont mind adds,"boosters, status quo sloth","special, person"

And I am working on the python course, do not know about the others. I HATE THE WRITING PARTS (most times). Usually it becomes a typing simulator that you have to fight. You need to get the text EXACTLY as they want it. The exact lower case and number of spaces. In some places they defined the field properly and it does not show up as being capitalized but in others you need to toggle the damn upper case off, for me pressing 2 times. Another pain is are the {} and other special symbols. For the most part they give you the symbols you need but only once. After you press one they go away and print comes up. Very annoying for ==. and_another_really_retarded_part_i_hate are the very long variable names that again you have to get just right, fighting the autocorrect that tries to maintain it's sanity by suggesting more and more desperate options.

Whole sections won't accept the correct answer, or let you pass until you find out the bug. I can get through typing the f-bomb as long as I click ""see solution"" then progress. Correct solution will let you pass? Lol no. What kind of sucker expects correct syntax or their money's worth. For the money they're charging, having a javascript course devolve into uselessness, and not even working at all on Bluestacks, and working terribly on native android is disgraceful. Pros: attractive interface, enjoyable enough to use and probably good for total beginners who find programming daunting and are in a time crunch or hobbyists. If you learn well by rote this may help. Cons: That's all it is. Rote. You can parrot the answers because you answer the same question 50 times but do you really understand it on a deep level? Probably not. For the price I expect a full version in-browser or on Windows, especially now Bluestacks has failed me it is of no use to me on Android devices. The options to choose to answer with semicolon, comma etc are far too small and an accessibility nightmare. Buggy at times and rolls back on mini-lesson you just completed on a semi-regular basis (on both native Android device and Bluestacks) and update as I said the bugs are disgraceful. I'd hang my head releasing this for money As someone already proficient in HTML and CSS and some JS this is going to introduce you to basics and concepts. The jump from this to real world programming is going to be huge for a lot of people and I would say almost too steep - so just be aware of that and dont give up. You will need to move on the edx, Udemy or MS Learn to start more advanced problem solving and/or a lot of practice for real world application. You migh be able to read (some) code but writing your more advanced code is going to be beyond you without major further education imho. W3C schools is also your friend. The CSS section is far too basic and missing a lot of the better features of CSS3. HTML is also missing many elements and concepts - no site layout was properly covered. Judging by reviews, a lot of people are not even aware of this fact. You barely scratched the surface. Know this going in. It's a starting bite only. I want to love this.

83428,83428,81428,2018-10-13 21:42:22,,"So, initially, I liked the app. It seemed like it was going to be super helpful. I did find the questions to be a little irritating because, like DuoLingo, there is no real lesson; it just has you learn through trial and error explaining only the bare minimum. In teaching lingo, it lacks some of the scaffolding needed to truly learn a topic. Still, I was interested. I was slightly bothered that it required accessing my email address even though I signed up through facebook. Why? Are you going to distribute my email to other parties? Then, in the second lesson, it wanted a rating already. I thought it was pretty early to ask that and was annoyed but snoozed it. I at least wanted to try two lessons before rating, especially since the first lesson was extremely short and I did not actually learn much. I went to continue on to a second lesson and it was locked. I realize you have to pay for a second lesson. Basically, the app is not free. You get one lesson per topic as a trial, but there is no free version of this app. So I'm irritated because I wasn't looking for a paid app. On top of it, the trial was not sufficient to test the product. Offer one whole section of real content for beginners and nothing else. Don't offer one short mini lesson on each. Additionally, a monthly subscription is a steep ask for an app like this. Once you buy a tutorial, you should own it to review it later. Still, all of these things being said, I pursued a second track and completed the first lesson. Command Line. It was actually really confusing. Not building blocks. Just threw you right in, again like DuoLingo for those who have used it. Trial by fire. I thought, maybe it's just command line. I added the Java track. I got two pages in and was totally lost. In fact it seemed to need additional software to complete the screen. I was beyond irritated. I decided to rate the app and delete it.

So far it seems ok but there's still bugs and I'm not sure that you will be able to write your own code by the end of it but I will update this again after I use it more and decide then. Until then, the devs are helpful and will respond to you. They mentioned adding more free content in future releases. I personally was not sold after the first 2 lessons and recommended they allow more than 2 free lessons. Again though, the app is still being developed, I hope to see a lot of improvements and I will keep this updated. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UPDATE: I have noticed in the ""loop"" section of the java course when ordering the code to display the factorial of 10 it constantly says you are wrong and does not let you continue. I have sent 2 emails but have recieved no replies yet. As for this I am contemplating on canceling my membership. You also need to add a Q&A in each course. Thank you. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NEWEST UPDATE: I am no longer using this app. No, you will not know a language well enough to code on your own, the developers have quit replying to emails. I've sent over 4 now.. The teaching methods are not well at all, there is no help area for those who have questions over an area you are learning as well and seeing how the dev's don't reply now you will be stuck. This seems to be more for money and not to actually help you learn a language. ""Sololearn"" is free and has so much more information and better teaching methods. If you get stuck in a course on MIMO then you might as well cancel your membership because you won't get passed and you also won't get help. (I figured out everything but was stumped a few times do to errors, I have finished complete courses). After the courses are complete you will still not have the knowledge you desire, you won't be able to write your own code.
