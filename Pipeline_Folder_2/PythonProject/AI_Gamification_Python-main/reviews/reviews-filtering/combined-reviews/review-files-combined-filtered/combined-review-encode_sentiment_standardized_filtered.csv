I greatly appreciate that you can use Encode even offline. (It being offline also means that it can't load the ads, if you find that annoying.)

The lessons included are indeed simple, and I absolutely think if you're an intermediate study in JavaScript or HTML/CSS you won't get much out of this. But as a beginner cramming these lessons in to/from work, who was only ever able to make good old 90's GeoCities webpages at best, the bite-sized chunks it's broken down into makes computing language much easier for to process.

The extra challenges as reinforcement and the compound lessons putting everything together is worth the $4.99 unlock, but even if you're looking to just start learning for free you could do much worse than Encode.",5,False,jellocube,Perfect for beginners!,,NEGATIVE,,,,,,,wanted learn coding commute many free start apps require constant internet connection train often stuck underground without service greatly appreciate use encode even offline offline also means cant load ads find annoying lessons included indeed simple absolutely think youre intermediate study javascript htmlcss wont get much beginner cramming lessons tofrom work ever able make good old 90s geocities webpages best bitesized chunks broken makes computing language much easier process extra challenges reinforcement compound lessons putting everything together worth 499 unlock even youre looking start learning free could much worse encode,challenges,challeng

But don‚Äôt get me wrong, this app is still very good at teaching the basics for coding in any of its available subjects. But just as someone who still remembers the very interactive mode of Encode, I do miss it. Personally it was better for me to type it out than to press buttons to questions.

148,148,148,2022-05-30 14:38:05,"I am a total beginner at coding and downloaded this app, as well as a few others. I want to say before giving my complaints/suggestions that this IS a decent way to memorize how to code. It doesn‚Äôt feel so much like learning through practice so much as learning through reading. It‚Äôs still informative and teaches you to code and what everything (well, most things) is for and how/why/when/where to use it. 

First off, just a minor suggestion for the devs: this app doesn‚Äôt keep score or reward  your progress really, other than ticking off the lessons you‚Äôve completed, which is fine honestly, it‚Äôs certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think it does make learning apps like this more enjoyable and fun to use. 

Second, the lessons feel a bit condescending sometimes. The way the answers to the questions are usually just the value of one of the blank spaces of the code and you just tap it and it appears in the space, and a lot of times it‚Äôs just one space that needs to be filled in so it just feels like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in me tapping the ONLY answer there is, and having it just appear in the blank space?‚Äù Feels a little kindergarten to me. And again, it DOES educate you on coding, it‚Äôs just more of a READING way of learning, like reading a slightly interactive book basically, where sometimes you need to fill in one of the sentences with the word(s) that belong there‚Ä¶literally. 

Third, and this is again just another personal opinion/suggestion based on preference, but the app just feels very plain and basic I guess is the best way to describe it. There‚Äôs just really no ‚Äúpop!‚Äù or personality to it. And I understand it‚Äôs an app about learning how to code, and code is often very plain and boring and concise looking, so I understand it not being anything crazy, I just wish there was a little more personality to the app and that it was a bit more interactive than it currently is. As mentioned above, there‚Äôs no reward or incentive for doing anything on there, which is fine, the learning of new things about coding is absolutely a reward in itself. However, it would be nice to have a little more feeling of connection and interaction with the app and a little more incentive and personality. 

I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a complainer just being captious about the app and picking it apart. I do appreciate the dev(s) taking the time to create this app to help people learn to code, because it is a nice little interactive textbook of coding information at this point, and it is appreciated being provided with that information. I just wish it didn‚Äôt feel so condescending and plain. With a few little tweaks I really think this app could be amazing because it does explain things very simply and easy to understand and learn. 

Thank you! If you made it this far and read the whole review, you‚Äôre beautiful and I wish you all the best in life and in coding!!! <3‚Ç¨><>

1276,1276,1092,2017-08-31 15:19:03,"Based on my experiences so far, I think this app would be great for beginners. It introduces each concept in a concise, step-by-step manner and provides regular practice exercises along the way - all of this helps the user memorize syntax, but also helps the user understand each aspect of the concept b/f moving on. For example, the app introduces variables by defining what a variable is, telling the user how to declare a variable, and giving the user practice with declaration before explaining assignment. The user then learns about assignment, and then gets practice with that b/f learning how to retrieve values. If you're familiar with programming this might come across as repetitive or too basic, but the gradual progression and regular opportunities for practice/review is crucial to helping beginners fully grok the fundamentals and recall key concepts, while avoiding confusion/frustration.  While I'm not new to programming, I downloaded this for extra practice, to familiarize myself with JavaScript syntax, and to review general programming constructs/concepts (ex. I appreciate that it eventually explains things like function scope and OOP).   While I don't think I'm its target audience, I think this app is better from a pedagogical POV, and uses the app form better than than a lot of the ""learn to code"" apps out there, which are often too ""textbook-like"" in their presentation. For example, I've encountered many ""learn to code apps"" that present concepts as dry walls of text, and/or introduce too many concepts at a time (if you're using an app you're probably just using it to pass time for a couple minutes, you're not really intending to get into a full study session - so this app's ""bite sized"" presentation is better tailored to how people actually use apps.) Also, many other apps  don't provide much in the way of practice/exercises (and/or the exercises aren't validated/""graded"" - newbies need the feedback that comes from ""graded"" exercises.). Also, the examples are presented in a fun/mildly humourous way. It takes what apps are good at (instant gratification and fun, short games), and uses that to help users learn - which is a feat that many ""learn to code"" apps haven't achieved.
