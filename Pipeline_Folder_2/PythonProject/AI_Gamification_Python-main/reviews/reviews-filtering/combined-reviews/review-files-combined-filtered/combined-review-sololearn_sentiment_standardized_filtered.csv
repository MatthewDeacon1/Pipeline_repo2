I hadn't even gotten through the third Javascript lesson yet before I got an alert saying that I'd run out of free practice.

The developer seemed to have fixed whatever the ad issue was that I and several other reviewers pointed out. (Original review is below this one)

The only thing I find kind of odd is that the developer doesn’t actually publicly acknowledge the ad issue, just tells you to contact support. To what end? The issue is obvious?

Regardless of the obvious misstep by SoloLearn support in responding to reviews. As I stated in my original review, the app is quite good. I’ve used it a lot over the past several months and there’s a lot to like and it works fantastically as a means to support other more thorough learning methods (videos, books, mentors, etc.)

I definitely recommend the app as someone looking to add a mobile resource to their learning routine. 

My main suggestion to the developer is to give more time on the challenges and require the authors of the questions to add descriptions and explanations to help aid learning and not just offer competition. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The newest update added a pretty awful feature. 

Ads that can’t be closed or skipped. You sit there looking at the ad thinking it’ll close in 30 seconds or so like every other free app... but no, you can sit there until the zombie apocalypse, it will never close. 

So now I get to force close the app every time I complete a section. 

All kidding aside...

The app so far is great– it's beginner friendly and very step by step, and you're able to look at solutions for practices when you're stumped. There are comment sections on the lessons where you can find helpful information from other users. 

My only problems would be that the ""challenge weapons"" (what code you can use for special challenges) do not include Kotlin, which is the main language I am learning. Many of the solutions for practices do not include what the lesson taught (for example, the Kotlin practice example for filtering arrays does not use that command, instead going for forEach.) They do work of course, but it isn't helpful to see what you did wrong in implementing what you learned. 

A minor problem is there is no way to contact support within the app itself. There is an email and a way to do it through the site, but I would appreciate there being one in the app as well. I haven't contacted support for this due to forgetting my login information (the main reason I would like support within the app) so take it with a grain of salt as there might be a solution, but I bought the annual pro subscription and have not been able to access some of the features promised– the main one being seeing past errors in your practices rather than having them being locked.

Sololearn has quickly grown to become one of my most used apps on my phone & it’s not because of the extensive library of courses, not because of the ability to create an account & save your progress, not because of the ability to add, train, and compete with your friends.

“ if you are a child under thirteen (13), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information.”

The Play Store via Android gives an ESRB rating of Teen (“Users interact.”) “Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. [...]” which is a much more accurate assessment of age-appropriateness.

The Age Rating these marketplaces assign to its apps are not the fault of the app developers, so given a (truer) target audience of 13+, I think this app deserves 4 stars.

I’m a pretty novice programmer, so the tutorials for learning Java have helped me a lot. My favorite feature after the compiler is the challenges, which have helped me hone my skills and practice.

My only real complaint is that the Java compiler has a few bugs - less than other compilers I’ve tried, and they don’t interfere too much in terms of running, but they can make the code look messy. Firstly, if you open a parenthesis or brackets, a second one pops up closing it (which is great), but deleting the first before typing anything doesn’t delete the second, and if you add another parenthesis to close out of habit, it just adds another parentheses. Also, tabbing sometimes produces inconsistent distances, or tabs on the wrong line. On a related note, the default template that appears when you start a new editor uses small tabs, but most times when you tab in the document, it makes a big tabs. One more bug is that if you hit enter and quickly start typing, it sometimes rearranged the letters you type. Undoing with control-z doesn’t work either. Sorry if I didn’t explain these well, I can explain better if you need! These are using the first iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard, by the way.

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file.

Learning code is easy and fun through this app. Which now, is more ludic than the previous version because now users are encouraged to explore further into coding with featured games, a forum, and a coding platform (I think it’s IDLE) so that you may write your own code and save it.

And in the heat of quickly realizing my mistake and wanting to quickly correct it to move on, I end up clicking on the wrong answer again because the answers were reshuffled a mere millisecond before I clicked on the right answer. I advise to remove the reshuffling since it’s frustrating and slows users down. 

Lastly, users want a responsive interaction. As for the drag and drop questions, it’s unclear to users whether or not the answer they’ve “picked up” is to be dragged or dropped because nothing happens when you press your finger on it.

1664,1664,1664,2018-04-14 22:06:10,"I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but there are a number of things that really bothered me about it when trying to learn C++ and test code snippets:

1. iOS’ loupe is broken in the code editor.  It places the caret where your thumb is pressing, instead of the center of the magnifying glass, so you can’t see exactly where it will be located.  This is especially frustrating because...
2. The editor automatically adds closing parentheses, brackets, braces, and double quotes after the caret.  This is an infuriating “feature” that I turn off in every environment I use, and I haven’t found a way to turn it off here.  Because of this, I must relocate the caret on nearly every line, which when combined with item 1 makes this app completely useless as a mobile coding environment.

Regarding the lessons themselves.

3. I understand that c++ throws so much more at you than most other languages when you first step into it, and you want to simplify as much as you can, but I strongly disagree with how much the lessons insist upon the line ""using namespace std;"", which I've since learned is pretty widely agreed upon as bad practice.

Even after you’ve completed the course, there are still fun things to do such as the coding playground. Recently they added other lessons create by users which is great, and there are also coding challenges which are basically quizzes against other players. It’s also 100% free!

71326,71326,69624,2018-09-06 18:27:12,"NEW PROGRAMMERS BE WARNED - as an experienced programmer, I installed this app to review some quick Python basics. It was sad to see that not only are a lot of the lessons out of order, but also inaccurate. For example, the operator precedence lesson for Python indicates that all boolean operators have equal precedence, when in reality they do NOT have equal precedence (Sololearn, I challenge you to go check the Python documentation and compare it to the erroneous guide you all posted). From greatest to least greatest precedence, the boolean operators should be ordered as: Not, And, Or. Fortunately, there are public comments for every single slide, so a lot of confusion is mitigated via these, but overall I can probably point out at least 5 to 10 other spots where a beginner would get easily confused by these lessons. If you want to truly learn programming, grab yourself a real, physical book, with legit examples and thorough explanations. It really doesn't cost that much...you'll thank not just me, but yourself later. Please thumbs up this review so that others striving to learn programming make the first step in the right direction as well - a physical book with proper lessons, not these terribly ordered quick concept cards occasionally sprinkled with misleading information.",2,,A Google user,,,NEGATIVE,5995c962-4aa6-422c-a713-364fbaba0403,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EGemoI2NTXmTsBVtJqk8jxF9rh8ApRWfsIMQSt2uE4OcpQqbFu7f7NbTK05lx80nuSijCz7sc3a277R67g,10.0,2.3.1,"Thanks for your report.

The comments on the tutorials are very helpful. However as far as learning different languages the tutorials could use some work. The examples are to short to few to grasp concepts without having to use other resources to understand them. Often times the answers they ask you after each tutorial can be completely unrelated to the current tutorial.  All of this review is based off completion of one language (Java). I will likely edit my review once I have more time with this app. Oh and before I forget the app asking me for a review several times before I finish a tutorial is slightly annoying. This may seem like a negative review but overall I must say I am very pleased with this app. I just wanted to give some positive criticism so hopefully some of these issues can be addressed.  7/3/17 - After a few months of using this app I felt like an update to my review was appropriate. Some of my previous issues with the app still apply most don't, for example it still asks me to review the app in the middle of tutorials. But that is such a minor annoyance compared to everything this app has taught me. The courses I talked about on my previous review about unrelated tutorial questions isn't so bad now since they keep adding new things to the tutorials and adding new tutorials too!

Then, the comments section, in which one can read other people opinions and write their own comments and questions. And the challenge-tests, they are both fun and instructive.  Then, I believe the ""incentive"" system with points, badges, etc is very well thought, to motivate the person who is learning. It is also very useful that it is one single app that integrates all the courses, instead of having separate apps for java, html, css etc. Though the level of the notions presented in these courses is far from being called advanced or comprehensive, the app does a very good job at initiating one in html, css, java, sql, etc. After one completes a course in SoloLearn, will be much easier to read and *understand* online documentation.

116059,116059,114357,2017-05-31 04:59:09,"I love this app. Its an excellent learning tool. Especially when you're on the go. I gave this 3 stars due to the fact that I feel some things are not thoroughly explained and some of the choices for variable use in code examples can be incredibly confusing. I have put a great deal of time into the Python course which is excellent. (However, the Python course is the worst I have seen about confusing variables, for instance instead of showing or explaining where a var was assigned. And instead of using an obvious variable name like x or y, they will sometimes use a word that to the uneducated could easily be a function or module or who knows. Which leaves you setting staring at a small piece of code trying to figure where this new word came from what its purpose is.) I also started and almost finished HTML. I cant say I am as impressed with it. I feel most of it is not thoroughly explained. Most of the excercises and quizzes can be done without reading a single word of the course as they are all fill in the blank type questions that can easily be solved by just paying attention to the  opposite (opening or closing) tag. So even though I have completed a large majority of the course, I feel as though I have grasped only the basic idea behind HTML. I feel the HTML course really could use a redesign as its just not currently designed to make the information stick in your memory as a course on anything should be.   Something else I feel would be absolutely invaluable to this app is a way to see how code is executed and in what order. Just something that shows each step the execution goes through and lets you go back and forth at your own pace. This would be excellent for helping to understand the order of precedence as well as simply putting a lot of the example snippets into perspective rather than making you set there trying to work out a puzzle in your head. Something else that would also be invaluable  to this app is suggesting excercises that will coincide with each lesson and will require you to use things in that lesson multiple times. For instance create a guess the number game in Python when learning to use range as well as getting user input. Not only would suggesting excercises help thoroughly cement lessons in your memory, but they would also show where different things are needed/useful. Its very easy to find yourself wanting to overlook things because they dont seem immediately useful to you.
