The current iPhone app makes sense as it allows new learners to practice what they’ve learned and currently learning on the go; hence, the “Go” in CodeAcademy Go.   I’m still not completely happy that the iPad version is just a miniature version of the Go app.  They should have created a full feature app on the iPad utilizing the bigger screen.

I’m learning so much more than I ever have with any other platform. The structure, pacing and format is unmatched by any other course I have seen so far and it has been worth every penny. That’s why I’m baffled by how low quality this app is. As many others have said, most of the quiz parts just straight up don’t work and when they do they are super unintuitive and confusing to answer. The review parts are ok but kind of all over the place and not in an order that makes sense to learn as a beginner (easier subjects to harder). All this said, to me it’s not a big deal because like I said, the actual Codecademy pro course is amazing and if you are serious about learning programming you aren’t going to do it on a smartphone. I downloaded this mostly out of curiosity but never had any intention of making it my main method of study. Anyone that’s dissatisfied with this app and is serious about learning I would strongly encourage you to try Codecademy’s free version on their website and see if the style fits you and if it does I would say take the plunge as it has been well worth it for me and I am getting insane value for what I paid.",1,False,Codecademy on computer is 10/10,dajufreak,NEGATIVE,,,,,,

You can’t just teach a beginner by just presenting random concepts in no particular order. I had no foundation to make sense of anything.

print(‘Hello world’)

Grats!

When I first began learning software development, resources were limited to books and websites with personal blogs…before smart phones, using Windows ‘99.

 I recently began ‘learning to code’ (I get some more accurate explanation would be remembering to code whilst learning about what’s changed in almost 15Y— i’ll admit it was a bit intimidating at first until I realise that just like always (at least when it comes to engineering/tech )Evolution is based in its simplest user friendly experience and so the UX/UI would be easy after a decade and a half of pivoting to finance for the 2nd half of my 20s. My goodness was I right.

I don’t know how to say this but python is a joke. In either case, I’ve returned to home my craft and I am blessed with a bittersweet life.

I grew up with crippling OCD/autism/ADHD and so the syntax and indentation that really bugs most developers was something I actually enjoy it and C++/CSS.

I am/was uniquely poised for this whole fintech/crypto revolution—Needless to say there were NOT many people that have an educational tantamount to an MBA in finance and Master’s computer science which is exactly what you need to fully understand fintech. I feel really stupid for paying 300 something bucks for annual subscription at DataCamp when FCC is more than enough in terms of educational resources in Data science/data analysis/machine learning/etc. 

From a former MIT grad: shout-out to the devs at FCC for expediting access to your personal resources, fundamentals and exercises. At this rate I should be up to speed by the end of the quarter! Thanks to ya’ll!

Why does the resume button at the top of the page not actually resume your progress in the course but take you to a testing ground? Why don’t they begin the programming languages at the beginning with the fundamentals? I kept feeling like i was missing out on content because i knew the lesson material changes and i was introduced to several new concepts (which is actually great because I’m still learning) but wasn’t taught to the point where i would be able to duplicate the results of the teacher, give a comprehensive understanding of what i was being shown, or felt like i could actually explain what i had learned. Why not have all the material you want to include in the lessons already there so you don’t have people swipe through five slides and then come back realizing there’s entirely new content? If i learn a new language i want to learn it well. 
I’m not an advanced programmer yet so there’s a lot of things i still don’t know, and the lessons introduced a page of code, and proceeded to explain one element.
