The current iPhone app makes sense as it allows new learners to practice what they’ve learned and currently learning on the go; hence, the “Go” in CodeAcademy Go.   I’m still not completely happy that the iPad version is just a miniature version of the Go app.  They should have created a full feature app on the iPad utilizing the bigger screen.  Though you can use the web browser to access their website, the coding interface is a bit buggy and cumbersome to use.

1,2022-05-24 10:11:39,"This app however is completely unusable. I bought Codecademy pro a few weeks ago (around 200$ for a year) and study on my laptop and it’s amazing. I’m learning so much more than I ever have with any other platform. The structure, pacing and format is unmatched by any other course I have seen so far and it has been worth every penny. That’s why I’m baffled by how low quality this app is. As many others have said, most of the quiz parts just straight up don’t work and when they do they are super unintuitive and confusing to answer. The review parts are ok but kind of all over the place and not in an order that makes sense to learn as a beginner (easier subjects to harder). All this said, to me it’s not a big deal because like I said, the actual Codecademy pro course is amazing and if you are serious about learning programming you aren’t going to do it on a smartphone. I downloaded this mostly out of curiosity but never had any intention of making it my main method of study. Anyone that’s dissatisfied with this app and is serious about learning I would strongly encourage you to try Codecademy’s free version on their website and see if the style fits you and if it does I would say take the plunge as it has been well worth it for me and I am getting insane value for what I paid.",1,False,Codecademy on computer is 10/10,dajufreak,NEGATIVE,app however completely unusable bought codecademy pro weeks ago around 200 year study laptop amazing im learning much ever platform structure pacing format unmatched course seen far worth every penny thats im baffled low quality app many others said quiz parts straight dont work super unintuitive confusing answer review parts ok kind place order makes sense learn beginner easier subjects harder said big deal like said actual codecademy pro course amazing serious learning programming arent going smartphone downloaded mostly curiosity never intention making main method study anyone thats dissatisfied app serious learning would strongly encourage try codecademys free version website see style fits would say take plunge well worth getting insane value paid
2,2022-06-01 05:24:21,"I tried the html module and it was completely impossible to follow! I got some cards with randomly generated concepts and some poorly made user-generated practice questions. I couldn’t travel back to a previous question, if I exited a lesson, I got a new, totally different lesson when I entered again. You can’t just teach a beginner by just presenting random concepts in no particular order. I had no foundation to make sense of anything. The only reason I can fathom for this level of incompetence is that some MBA decided to cut costs by cutting educators out of education. I’m attributing the one star I’m forced to give to the fact that I was able to easily cancel my trial.

Edit: I talked to a friend and they were confused by my description of CodeAcademy content. So I spent some time researching and found out this is a “companion app” to the actual product.

print(‘Hello world’)

Grats!

When I first began learning software development, resources were limited to books and websites with personal blogs…before smart phones, using Windows ‘99.

 I recently began ‘learning to code’ (I get some more accurate explanation would be remembering to code whilst learning about what’s changed in almost 15Y— i’ll admit it was a bit intimidating at first until I realise that just like always (at least when it comes to engineering/tech )Evolution is based in its simplest user friendly experience and so the UX/UI would be easy after a decade and a half of pivoting to finance for the 2nd half of my 20s. My goodness was I right.

I don’t know how to say this but python is a joke. In either case, I’ve returned to home my craft and I am blessed with a bittersweet life.

I grew up with crippling OCD/autism/ADHD and so the syntax and indentation that really bugs most developers was something I actually enjoy it and C++/CSS.

I am/was uniquely poised for this whole fintech/crypto revolution—Needless to say there were NOT many people that have an educational tantamount to an MBA in finance and Master’s computer science which is exactly what you need to fully understand fintech. I feel really stupid for paying 300 something bucks for annual subscription at DataCamp when FCC is more than enough in terms of educational resources in Data science/data analysis/machine learning/etc.
