The only language I had a basic grasp going in was python, but I started taking the web-development courses(currently 20% to certification) and have been able to fly through at my own pace. Mimo encourages learning through a healthy sense of challenge/competition but keeps it from becoming demanding. It challenges you just enough to keep you interested. Best part is the app is free, enacting a ‚Äúlives system‚Äù like your typical phone game would. The lives(5 to be exact) are pretty much enough to get you through one day assuming you don‚Äôt go premium. Once you run out it‚Äôs roughly three hours for one heart, essentially encouraging coming back daily to learn. It also has a simple daily streak mechanic that further encourages daily involvement and the previously mentioned competition is a leaderboard that slightly encourages trying harder when learning.

I bought the app during a Christmas deal, and it was worth it. Honestly, the full price would have been worth it, too. My main qualm comes from the fact that the content seems to have severely diminished in recent weeks. There used to be cool mini-courses on all types of different subjects, and I believe at one point early on when I first got the app, there was even a gallery to see top projects from others. Overall, I think the largest issue that will have to be addressed for Mimo to stay on the path of success and even burgeon in the future is communication and community. I feel like the dev team isn‚Äôt connected with the users. The social media hasn‚Äôt been active for years. The emails receive no responses and the bug reports may be harkened to, though there‚Äôs not even a ticket given in a courtesy email so one wouldn‚Äôt know.

However, it would be much more beneficial that the hearts would refill itself a bit faster than 4 hours, maybe maximum 1-2 hours. This is especially significant because half of the time I lose hearts due to the directions being obscure. Even then, I learn best after making mistakes, and losing all the hearts fast means my inability to keep learning which discourages me from opening the app at all.

If I were one of the developers of the app, I‚Äôd know the hearts is a good tactic for users to buy Mimi pro. On the other hand, I‚Äôd know that if I stretched that tactic too far, there would be less traffic on the app, which means less ad revenue in the first place. This is especially true considering the majority of users don‚Äôt have a pro subscription.

If you could shorten the time down to 1-2 hours I feel it would be perfect.

878,2022-04-28 00:14:47,,"This app is very helpful for grasping and visualizing the basics of programming. I love the mini apps it walks you through along the way because most of my discouragement while learning programming has been ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶ I know what this does‚Ä¶ but what do I use it for?‚Äù Lol. The leader boards add a nice competitive touch that keep me engaged as well. The only negative thing I would say is that there can be an awful lot of hand-holding, even when you‚Äôre further into a topic. For example I was just going through comparisons in JavaScript and it spent several pages telling me how a greater-than (>) operator checks to see if one value is greater than another. But on the final page the instructions were ‚Äúcheck if this number is greater than another *by typing >*‚Äù. Personally I feel like it‚Äôs harder to lock those ideas in because you don‚Äôt really have to. The instructions tell you exactly what you need to pass, and if you get an answer wrong it immediately corrects you by telling you the right thing to type. In one sense I understand you don‚Äôt want to make it too hard for beginners. But in another it almost feels like it removes the necessity for me to access my own memory and solve the problem myself. Like if I was learning math and something said, ‚ÄúSolve 5+5 by typing 10.‚Äù It feels disappointing at times because I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll shoot. I would have liked to initiate my own brain resources to figure that out, but I‚Äôve accidentally glanced at the answer by reading the question.‚Äù Lol. However, it should be noted that at later modules it does pull back and let you work things out by yourself a little more. So it‚Äôs not a COMPLETELY overbearing teacher. 

BESIDES that possibly minor nit-pick though, I really love this app. I‚Äôve tried a few others and they don‚Äôt feel nearly as engaging. They tend to fall on the other side of the spectrum where they either just leave you hanging without much clue what to do. Or there‚Äôs no interactivity and it‚Äôs just strictly multiple choice questions. This app actually has you type things out (or select from predefined options, which is easier to handle on mobile).

Overall a great learning tool!",4,False,authordrsilva,Very helpful for grasping the basics,POSITIVE,app helpful grasping visualizing basics programming love mini apps walks along way discouragement learning programming okay know use lol leader boards add nice competitive touch keep engaged well negative thing would say awful lot handholding even youre topic example going comparisons javascript spent several pages telling greaterthan operator checks see one value greater another final page instructions check number greater another typing personally feel like harder lock ideas dont really instructions tell exactly need pass get answer wrong immediately corrects telling right thing type one sense understand dont want make hard beginners another almost feels like removes necessity access memory solve problem like learning math something said solve 55 typing 10 feels disappointing times im thinking well shoot would liked initiate brain resources figure ive accidentally glanced answer reading question lol however noted later modules pull back let work things little completely overbearing teacher besides possibly minor nitpick though really love app ive tried others dont feel nearly engaging tend fall side spectrum either leave hanging without much clue theres interactivity strictly multiple choice questions app actually type things select predefined options easier handle mobile overall great learning tool

1093,2020-08-16 08:04:11,,"(Be ready for a long review :)) 
 I have used this app for a while now and although I really love this app, the biggest problem is the hearts/lives. I wish that there would be either more lives, or lives that come back quicker. The lives take too long to return (4 hours/heart) and it discourages me a little. Sometimes I would accidentally pick the wrong choice or have a typo (as there is no autocorrect in coding) and poof, a heart is gone. 
The hearts are the biggest flaw but here are some of the minor flaws...the instructions and friend invites. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me, but sometimes a question is unclear and I have to really think about what the right answer is. And because the hearts take a long time to return, when I only have one heart left, I just end up quitting the lesson and choosing a different one. Second is the friend invites. Recently, I found out that you can invite friends to earn a free week of pro so I sent out a couple of invites. I had one friend sign up for Mimo and it shows up that I have seven days of Mimo pro but my account is still in the free version. Additionally, I‚Äôve had some people tell me that they signed up for mimo using my invitation link, but it only shows up as seven days. 
Overall, this is a really great app and I really enjoy it. The interface is nice and fun, and it definitely keeps you hooked to do more lessons. I understand that the mimo team is very small and not everything will be fixed right away, but I really hope they consider changing the heart reload time :)",4,False,Ana(stasi)a,"Nice app, couple of flaws (including hearts)",NEGATIVE,ready long review used app although really love app biggest problem heartslives wish would either lives lives come back quicker lives take long return 4 hoursheart discourages little sometimes would accidentally pick wrong choice typo autocorrect coding poof heart gone hearts biggest flaw minor flawsthe instructions friend invites dont know sometimes question unclear really think right answer hearts take long time return one heart left end quitting lesson choosing different one second friend invites recently found invite friends earn free week pro sent couple invites one friend sign mimo shows seven days mimo pro account still free version additionally ive people tell signed mimo using invitation link shows seven days overall really great app really enjoy interface nice fun definitely keeps hooked lessons understand mimo team small everything fixed right away really hope consider changing heart reload time

They currently have SQL and Python languages. There is also a section for web development using HTML that integrates the process of building websites, however I have not looked into this to date. 

They have introductory lessons of learning, but I will provide an update in my response. I am really loving this app due to the fact that I personally practiced Python in the past, but seemed to have issues remembering some aspects to properly complete a working program that functions without syntax errors. As I have been doing the lessons, it is all coming back.

I am VERY curious of whether they intend on adding more languages into this application, as it is very resourceful. I‚Äôm excited to see the development of this app!

The only complaint I have is that they offered a 50% discount for the pro version due to the current hardships of some people face during current events. I wanted to see if it was worth it before making the purchase, however it took a few days to get past a few lessons and realize that this application is an asset. Now the offer previously offered is no longer available‚Ä¶ I wish I could have taken advantage of this opportunity, however it has expired before I realized the potential. 

In any case, I recommend this app for those of all levels. It takes some time to make it past the introductory portion, and I wish there would have been a test to get past the first few lessons.

1298,2020-06-17 09:07:17,,"I‚Äôll preface this review with a fact about me; I rarely write reviews. It takes a lot for something to either wow me enough or disappoint me enough to leave a review. In the case of Mimo, it frankly has knocked my socks off! 

I‚Äôm using Mimo alongside precourse material for my upcoming bootcamp and honestly, it‚Äôs providing more information in a more accessible format. Everything is explained very well and delivered in a way that just clicks with how I learn. 

You‚Äôre also given the opportunity to really drill the information into your head by maxing out the stars. It can be a bit repetitive to do this but I actually think that‚Äôs a good thing; once I get annoyed with covering the same thing over and over I know I‚Äôve got the knowledge. 

I‚Äôm always a bit hesitant with app based learning programs because I always feel like I‚Äôm going to get to the point where I want to learn more and then they‚Äôll tell me that I need to upgrade. That‚Äôs not the case with Mimo! The free version is very robust and has all of the information on HTML, CSS, and JS that you need to get started. The only thing I can see that would require a membership is the projects which, while great, aren‚Äôt necessary to learn the information; mainly just practice. 

Unfortunately, I was planning on learning the material first and then tackling the projects but my discounted pro price expired. It‚Äôs all good though, as I said, the free version is great! There‚Äôs a small ad at the end of each lesson but they‚Äôre very easy to click out of and only last a couple of seconds. 

The only thing I‚Äôd like to see from Mimo is an option to access the lessons from a computer. Obviously, I‚Äôm not going to be doing web dev on my phone so it would be nice to get the practice in on desktop. Projects are available on desktop though so if I decide to spring for a pro subscription I will be taking advantage of that. 

I‚Äôll end this with a thank you to Mimo for providing this amazing service! If you‚Äôre thinking about trying this app, absolutely go for it! 

Tldr: this app slaps.

1331,2021-06-10 23:11:28,,"If you‚Äôre looking for a free learning app, I can‚Äôt suggest this one unless the heart system gets reworked. Basically you have 5 hearts and lose 1 every time you get an answer wrong. You can get your hearts back but it takes 4 hours each. 1 at a time.

Aside from this, it would be a 5 star app. I love everything else about it.

Basically there comes a time where you might need to wait at least 4 hours to continue learning. That‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre not allowed to learn when you want to unless you pay or just go start over on another free app that doesn‚Äôt do this. Oh and I say at least 4 hours because if you lose all of your hearts, you might want to wait until you have 2 hearts for padding before you try again. Falling to 0 hearts means you may have to start your lesson over. The lessons are short, but it‚Äôs frustrating.

So how easy is it to lose hearts?

Okay so I accidentally wrote ‚Äúpoo()‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpop().‚Äù A funny mistake, but I lost a heart. Next I was following instructions on something and it didn‚Äôt tell me if I should add the curly brackets yet or not. Well apparently not, and I lost a heart even though the curly brackets were supposed to go there. Mimo just didn‚Äôt want me to add them yet. Another time I actually wrote the correct answer and it failed me and told me to write the same thing.

Even without the bugs or silly mistakes, some multiple choice questions are asked before you learn the answer.

1375,2020-05-21 22:12:53,,"I came to Mimo as an absolute novice when it comes to coding. I had minimal experience with HTML and no experience whatsoever with any other coding languages. At first, I found the lessons fun and engaging, and within a couple of weeks I felt like I had a decent understanding of the basic mechanics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These principals are taught in bite-sized lessons, similar in structure to Duolingo. Two things the program does really well is providing side projects that allow you to apply your knowledge and skill challenges that allow you to test your understanding of the material. This is what drew me in initially.  

However, when I tried to dive deeper into some of the other lessons Mimo has to offer, I was incredibly disappointed by how shallow the material was. Their Python course, for example, is only spread out over 11 lessons, and there are none of the aforementioned skill challenges or side projects that allow you to solidify your knowledge. I had the same experience when trying to learn C#. It seems that they‚Äôve put quite a bit of work into HTML, CSS, and JS, but not nearly enough into their other offerings. 

They have a system in place where you can repeat a lesson three times (which I only learned by contacting tech support - nowhere in the app does it tell you this), with each level supposedly being more difficult than the last. Except they‚Äôre not more difficult - it‚Äôs mostly just the same info, over and over again. Half of the questions tell you exactly what to do, so it feels more like rote repetition than actual learning.

Honestly I bet that may be a flaw and a cause for people to leave the app as soon as they get it. 
A suggestion for this would be maybe look at letting users do higher levels, but without a subscription put the it on a time limit. If funding is that big of an issue, I don‚Äôt really know how well newer users will do. For example:

Letting users unlock all the levels, however. For every activity (getting started, etc.) have an extended wait until they could do the next level (30 mins, 3 hrs, 1 day, etc.). This way users would still be pushed to get a subscription, but can still access and enjoy the app. Also, maybe insert adds in-between lessons for non-subscriptions, or you could even put the option of using adds to shorten the wait time by a bit. 

That being said, the app in itself looks really great!

I love the concept of this app and a lot of things are made quite clear and concise through the lessons. I found the introduction to hacking very straightforward.

I was also a bit disappointed by the need to pay $50/year in order to do just about anything in the app. You really should give a more in-depth preview before you force people to pay. Also, if you already have programming experience, it‚Äôs unclear if you can skip ahead to more advanced topics. Maybe the target audience is only complete beginners, but if that‚Äôs the case then the $50/year is _definitely_ not worth it. Also, as sort of a side note, the update notes here on the App Store are bugged out. How can you not have noticed that???
